The first few words are always the hardest, you know? Just like anyone's first steps in New Eden. You can feel very overwhelmed by literally anything. Terminology, abbreviations, politics, Jita local, different modules, industry, what you can do, what you should do, and what you can't do. My name is Vladimir Memento and I hope, that this comprehensive Eve Online guide, I'm bringing you here today, will help you. Doesn't matter if you are a newbro that doesn't know what the hell is going on, a retired vet that is thinking of coming back but needs some motivation, or just a random guy who wanted to get into industry.


All the written material you read here was written by hand, all the links you find are not mine - they have been created by others and posted publicly on the internet, I'm just linking them for your convenience. Some things have been directly quoted from UniWiki, those are labeled with a "(from UniWiki)".


I really hope you find something useful in this guide. It took me 3 months of research, a lot of typing, but also a lot of fun. Also, if you have any questions about the game or have any ideas on what else to include in the guide, feel free to drop a message in game.




Fly safe and have fun.


The guide is up to date for the April 2020 release.

Chapter 2. Rules
Rules (in no particular order):


1. If you're flying something expensive/with expensive cargo, you have a high chance to die, even in highsec.
2. Being docked in an NPC station or cloaked in a deep safe spot are the only times you're actually safe.
3. More expensive/bigger doesn't necessarily mean better
4. Never autopilot when hauling something you don't wanna lose
5. Don't fly something you cannot afford to lose.
6. Don't put expensive cargo in a T1 industrial.
7. Train multiple accounts (not characters!) at once, so it doesn't take you months to train after you decide what you want to do.
8. Don't wait until you have your skills ready. Go and do stuff!
9. ISK doublers, and most Jita contracts are scams. Double check them every time.
10. Don't log off if the fight has already started. You will be in space for at least another 10 minutes, because of the logoff timer.
11. Concord will always punish, but rarely save.
12. If you're new, do career agents' missions first.
13. If you're new, exploration is your best friend.
14. Be space poor doing what you love, rather than become space rich and quit, it's a game, not your second job.
15. Always bookmark wormhole exit.
16. Learn how to Dscan properly and do it all the time, unless in highsec
17. Always insure your ship
18. Always have something in your skill queue
19. Most important character skills:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyVgIsZw47g
20. Unless you're warp bubbled, you can save your pod almost every time, learn how to do it, if you're planning to buy implants
21. Overheating can give you enough edge in a fight to come out on top
22. If you have questions you can ask: in Rookie Help channel,  in your corporation/alliance newbro channel,  in a Discord help channel,  on forums,  on Reddit (r/evenewbies, r/eve)
23. Always have at least 1 safespot per system, when not in highsec
24. Skillpoints and implants can give you an edge in close PVP fights
25. If you always learn from your mistakes, after some time you won't have any mistakes to learn from
26. If you're new to the game, don't start out with mining. Seriously, don't. Join a newbie friendly nullsec group like Pandemic Horde or Brave Newbies and ask a ton of questions.
27. If you do industry, buy with buy orders and sell with sell orders
28. If you are looking for a way to fit your ship: check UniWiki and type the name of the ship (this will give you some example fittings), go on zKillboard and check for recent losses of those ships, ask on r/fittings, in corp chat etc.






Bonus Pro Tip: Many new players start off doing security missions or mining. The truth is those activities suck. Seriously. They are unprofitable and really tedious. If you like that kind of content then check out Abyssal Sites (more challenging, fun and profitable PVE that can be done in 3 man squad) or gas harvesting (more profitable, less boring and you can also explore at the same time if you fit some analyzers onto your Venture).














































































Chapter 3. Areas of space
New Eden is made out of regions, which can be classified into sectors, which are made out of constellations, which consist of systems. Woah, slow down! Let's break it down:


* Systems, the smallest parts of space, here you can find NPC or player stations, moons, suns, planets etc.
* Constellations, they are made out of a couple of systems, they're not really that important, the only times you'll really hear about them are with incursions, triglavian invasions and K-space gas
* Regions: they consist of constellations, there are empire regions (highsec and lowsec) and outlaw, nullsec regions, which can be held by players (except NPC regions); often highly related to politics


Security sectors:




Highsec - 1.0 to 0.5 - basically, here we have 3 Walmarts (Jita>Amarr>Dodixie) also known as major trade hubs, and most of the players come to one of them to do their trading, you can buy and sell almost everything for a pretty decent price. There are also 2 grocery stores (Hek and Rens), a.k.a. minor trade hubs, where you can buy many popular items, but for those fancy ones, you often gotta go all the way to Jita. Between those hubs there are people hauling their own or someone else's stuff from one to another to make a profit. Those guys sometimes then get killed by gankers who prey on them, to get their loot and adorn their killboards. You can also find people who try and make a living doing industry, often in their own structures. Other than that, there are krabs who do security missions or mine, and incursionists. All other interesting stuff happens in null. It's pretty safe here, unless you're carrying a lot of expensive stuff, then you can get ganked.


Lowsec - 0.4 to 0.1 - the home of pirates, who will try to kill you for money or for fun (usually gate camping), and also there is Faction Warfare which is kinda a combination of those 2, living in 50% of lowsec is dangerous unless you know what you're doing, the other 50% is usually dead quiet and you can find a lot of wormholes, usually combat here is done solo or in small gangs. Remember - you can get killed there and nothing will save you. Your killers will get security status drop but that's it.


Nullsec - 0.0 and below - there are certain corporations and alliances set up here (for more info check "Politics" chapter) and it's surprisingly safe if you're close to the home system of being in one of them, other than that, it's wild west, you can kill without any consequences, people travel in between their systems using jumpgates, and if they want to get some kills in the enemy territory they use wormholes. Those big groups have their own, very well stocked, market; great infrastructure, you have structures for pretty much everything here: manufacture, invention, copying, reactions etc., and you can sell most of your stuff right next door. You also usually have well planned logistics: haulers between home and a trade hub, buybacks who buy your stuff in bulk for a decent price and big ships you can order. There are also parts of null which are super empty so you can travel constellations peacefully exploring without even checking DScan. Generally, here materials are cheaper and modules/gear more expensive. The only laws that exist here are player-made.




JSpace - living in wormholes, a very challenging and dangerous activity, but almost everything here is better: best planets in the game, high quality moons, rats that give more money, gas, pirate data/relic sites (if you live in C3 or below), connections that change everyday and you can roll them too if you're looking for content. It's a double edged sword though, you have to look for a highsec connection if you want to sell/buy anything, with that comes fueling your POS which can be painful and enemies lurking everywhere, you never know because there is no local. Overall it's much more exciting but it can be seriously boring if there aren't any good connections and/or you don't have a scanner.




Wormholes can be described as C1-C6. C1 being the easiest and C6 being the hardest. The harder the wormhole the better (but harder) the rats and gas. Each wormhole has at least 1 static (connection to a certain space type that immediately respawns after closing). Pirate data/relic sites (the ones without NPCs) only appear in C1-C3 + shattered C4s. Shattered wormholes have multiple additional statics, you can't do PI and certain sites can spawn there. Wormholes can also have an additional effect, which give you some certain good and bad effects. You can check details about the wormhole here: http://anoik.is/systems (use Ctrl+F)




*Local - chat that shows you who is with you in the system, doesn't work in wormholes, unless the person speaks (then only this person is visible).




























Chapter 4. Ship classes
INDUSTRIALS:
* T1 Industrials - most basic industrials, usually squishy, low base cargohold, and relatively long align time, they can be configured to be really good in one of the categories, but will be really bad at everything else
* T2 Deep Space Transport - much higher cargo capacity compared to T1 (3-10x more), +2 warp core bonus, so it's much harder to tackle, decent tank and also tanking bonuses, designed to bust their way through any enemies
* T2 Blockade Runners - very agile, super fast align time, can fit Cov Ops cloaks, little less cargo capacity than T1 (unless fitted for it), designed to carry expensive stuff, only real danger are null bubbles
* T1 Freighters - HUGE cargo capacity (up to 1.2m m3), insanely slow align time, really tanky (325-385k EHP, excl. Bowhead), but can still be suicide ganked, usually require support (webs, scouts) to stay safe, only used in highsec, only have low slots
* T2 Jump Freighters - decent cargo capacity (130-180k m3), very high tank (350-440k base EHP) can use jump drive (teleportation to a lit cyno, requires fuel), cannot jump drive into highsec, require at least 2 pilots, pretty much the safest transport in the game, only have low slots




MINERS:
* Mining Frigate - basic ship used for mining, cannot fit strip miners or ice harvesters (Venture)
* Mining Barge - much higher yield than mining frigate, can use strip miners and ice harvesters (Procurer, Covetor, Retriever)
* Expedition Frigate - cloaky, hard to catch, gas/ice miners (Prospect, Endurance)
* Exhumer - T2 mining barges, better than them all across the board (Skiff, Hulk, Mackinaw)
* ORE Industrial - Noctis, the best salvaging ship in the game
* Industrial Command Ship - basically Rorqual Junior, additionally, Porpoise doesn't have a ship hangar, while Orca has one with 400k m3 (Orca, Porpoise)
* ORE Capital Industrial - Rorqual, mining beast, best yield in the game, good tank, bonuses for fleets, has 1m ship hangar, can fit Pulse Activated Nexus Invulnerability Core module (one time 5 min invulnerability)








COMBAT:
* Interceptor - very fast T2 frigates, used for scouting and tackling, you are fast enough to catch anyone while avoiding their damage, also useful for quick travel
* Assault Frigate - fast frigates with good tank and high DPS, can fit assault damage controls, generally the strongest direct combat frigates
* Covert Ops - frigates, specifically used for scouting, that can stay pretty much permanently cloaked (covops cloak), have scanning bonuses, used for e.x. gathering intelligence for a surprise attack, or just high level exploration
* Electronic Attack Ship - frigates with very strong EWAR
* Flag Cruiser (Monitor) - ship designed for FCs, insanely hard to kill, immune to ECM, very resistant to other EWAR types, very high EHP and agility, very small signature size (hard to hit), has almost no offensive capabilities and is pretty expensive
* Logistics Frigate - specialized, T2 frig sized logi, much more effective than T1 equivalents
* Interdictor - T2 destroyers, launch warp disrupt bubbles that stop nearly everyone from warping (excluding Interceptors and nullified T3C), key role in nullsec fleet fights
* Command Destroyer - T2 destroyers, that are more tanky, can fit a Command Burst and a Micro Jump Field Generator, have less DPS than T1 destroyers
* Tactical Destroyer - T3 destroyer that is very versatile, much better than T1 and T2, and can switch modes to become either: more tanky/harder to hit; faster; or higher damage/range
* Combat Recons - good damage and tank, invisible on DScan, their main purpose is applying EWAR while also doing significant damage, good for surprise attacks/backup
* Force Recons - little worse in combat compared to combat recons, same EWAR bonuses, are seen on DScan but they can fit covops cloaks and light cynos
* Heavy Assault Cruisers - incredibly versatile, can be fit for sniping or close range, very tanky, high DPS, fast and agile,
* Heavy Interdictor Cruisers - T2 cruisers, very good tank, almost no DPS, but they have the heaviest tackle in the game - they can either launch an interdictor kind of bubble, or infinite strength warp disruptor; when they are using their tackle module they can't be repped, [become slower, and easier to hit (only in bubble mode)] but in exchange they become more agile
* Logistics Cruiser - specialized, T2 cruiser sized logi, much more effective than T1 equivalents
* Command Ships - T2 battlecruisers, very tanky, strong DPS, have bonuses for command bursts and can fit 2 of them (most of any subcap)
* Black Ops - T2 battleships, have very high damage, drone bandwidth, can fit cloaks, have jump drives (teleportation to a lit cyno, requires fuel), can light cynos, used for infiltration, extremely expensive
* Stealth Bombers - squishy, cloaky T2 frigates, that can fit torpedoes and bombs, which have very high alpha strikes and can burst unsuspecting targets (bombs can only be used in null and J-Space)
* Marauders - T2 battleships used specifically for PVE, can fit Bastion Module, expensive but efficient
* SoE Ships - ships used for explorations and roaming, often also fit for PVP, can fit cov ops cloaks (used for solo, at best small gang gameplay)
* Strategic Cruisers - T3 cruiser, the weirdest ship class in the game, have no module slots and must install heavily customizable subsystems which give them very good bonuses and allow the use of normal modules, there are 4 subsystem subclasses: Core (power grid, CPU, high and mid slots, sensors), Offensive (weapon hardpoints, high slots, sometimes mid and low too, bonuses to weapon ranges, rate of fire, drones, Command Burst capabilities), Defensive (armor/shield HP, resistances, reps effectiveness ability to use Cov Ops cloak), and Propulsion (mid slots, agility, prop mod bonuses, non targeted interdiction nullification); you must fit all the subsystems in order to use the ship, when you lose your ship you will randomly lose 1 level of racial subsystem skill.






CAPS:
* Dreadnoughts - DPS machines, can fit siege module, which immobilizes it, but gives it huge damage, greatly increased local reps, partial EWAR and full ECM resistance
* FAX -most powerful logi in the game, can fit triage module, which immobilizes it, but gives it absurd amounts of both local and remote reps, almost instant locks, huge range, more max. targets, partial EWAR and full ECM resistance
* Carriers - support ships, they have 1m m3 cargo, used only for assembled ship, so if you die you can quickly grab a new one, they let other ships refit in space (like a Mobile Depot), can use Fighters (very strong, diverse SmartDrones), can fit 2 Command Bursts, insanely tanky (can get to over 1.5m EHP), commonly used for ratting
* Supercarriers - mega carriers, can fit 2 additional fighters (5 total), burst projectors, and 1 additional Command Burst (3 total), can only dock in Keepstars (XL citadels), second largest ship in the game, commonly used for ratting
* Titans - largest and most powerful ships in the game, they can go over 16m EHP, fit Doomsday modules (high cooldown, one million damage module), can fit Jump Portal Generators (creating temporary jump bridges for fleet members) and Phenomena Generators (AoE, double edged sword bonuses for all ships)


With the new update (March 2020) all Battleships also have a Frigate Escape Bay which allows you to store one frigate and immediately board it once your main ship gets blown up.


*All capital ships can use jump drive.


























Chapter 5. Crimewatch






1. Log-off timers
* they prevent you from combat logging
* start counting down after all your modules have completed their cycles and you have finished warping
* if you just log off before entering combat you're gonna have to wait 60s before your ship disappears from space (30s if you use safe logoff feature)
* extended to 5 minutes after you enter combat with NPCs
* extended to 15 minutes after you enter PVP combat




2. Weapon timers
* become active when you activate an offensive module on another player (weapons, scrams, webs, target painters etc.) OR smartbombs and bastion modules
* prevent you from docking, jumping gates, ejecting, boarding, storing ship in a corporation/fleet hangar
* last 60s after all offensive modules have been deactivated






3. Ship safety settings
* 3 different settings: full safety, partial safety, no safety
* after selecting a safety setting you can't perform an activity that would cause you to get a timer, lower than the selected setting
* prevent you from accidentally doing something bad and getting your ship destroyed
* example: you can’t shoot somebody in highsec if your safety is yellow (because that would get you a red, criminal flag), but you can in lowsec (because that would give you the yellow, suspect flag)




4. Suspect timers
* other players can shoot you without any consequences
* last 15 minutes
* in highsec you get it by: stealing from a container, engaging mobile structures or having a kill right activated on you
* in lowsec you get it by: attacking a player's ship, stealing from a container








5. Criminal timers
* other players can shoot you without any consequences, you'll get concorded in highsec
* last 15 minutes
* in highsec you get it by attacking a ship or a capsule who's not a valid target
* valid targets are: war targets, suspects, criminals, people with sec. status at or below -5.0 and people who are in limited engagement with you
* in highsec you can also get it by: assisting players with criminal timers, smartbombs
* in highsec you can't initiate warp or jump gates and will be fired upon by gate guns (~700 dps)
* in lowsec you get it by: attacking a capsule, assisting players with criminal timers
* in lowsec you'll only get fired upon by gate guns (~350 dps), Concord won't appear and you'll be free to warp off




6. Concord
* only appear in highsec
* warp in after 6-19s depending on system's security status
* destroy your ship in the matter of seconds
* can be dragged out to slow down the response by 5s




7. Limited engagements
* players may freely engage each other
* activated after accepting a duel invitation or getting attacked (to allow you to defend yourself)
* last for 5 minutes after the last shot is fired
* people interfering between the people fighting e.x. using remote support modules will get a suspect timer




8. Kill rights

Chapter 6. Meta
T1 (Meta 0) - manufactured by players, from normal minerals (Tritanium, Isogen, Zydrine, Pyerite etc.), using blueprints sold by NPCs


Meta (Meta 1-2) - named items dropped by NPC ships (except for capital modules), better than T1 modules, while often being cheaper and having same skill requirements, the higher the meta, the better the item, their names start with:


* Upgraded: Straight-up better stats
* Compact: Reduced fitting cost (less CPU and powergrid use)
* Enduring: Longer cycle time and/or lower capacitor use
* Ample: Higher capacity
* Scoped: Longer range
* Restrained: Less severe drawbacks
(from UniWiki)


T2 (Meta 5) - created in a fairly complicated process called Invention. Compared to T1s, they have higher skill requirements, are generally better but have higher fitting requirements (powergrid and CPU). They don't really go below 500k in prices, because they require datacores and the invention doesn't always end in a success. Some T2 modules can be very expensive as well.


T3 (ships only) - Tactical Destroyers and Strategic Cruisers, most advanced ships in the game, very long and complicated industry process, T3 cruisers are especially expensive, advanced and have high SP requirements.


Faction (usually Meta 6-8) - purchased from faction LP stores or dropped by high level, faction NPCs (also known as Commander spawns). Now, because you can't kill empire ships the way you kill pirate ships, all the faction modules, that aren't from pirate factions can only be purchased from their empires' respective LP stores. It works a little different for pirates though. Pirate faction items can either drop or be bought from LP stores. Ship modules only drop as loot from wrecks. Faction: ammo, unique implants and ship BPCs both drop and can be purchased from LP stores. However finding implants or ship BPCs in a wreck is extremely rare*. Faction items are equal or superior to T2s, often require less CPU/Powergrid/capacitor, have same skill requirements as T1s, they tend to be expensive, their names also tell you the faction and start with:




* Amarr Navy (Amarr)
* Ammatar Navy (Ammatar)
* Caldari Navy (Caldari)
* Dark Blood (Blood Raiders)
* Domination (Angel)
* Dread Guristas (Guristas)
* Gallente Navy (Gallente)
* Republic Fleet (Minmatar)
* Sentient (Drones)
* Sisters (Sisters of Eve)
* Shadow Serpentis (Serpentis)
* True Sansha (Sansha)


You can easily distinguish Commander spawns I mentioned earlier - their names are similar to the item names. For example NPC whose name starts with Dread Guristas drops Dread Guristas faction modules/ammo.


*Doesn't apply to Mordu's Legion, their rats are fairly rare and have a 100% chance to drop BPC of the ship you killed.




Storyline (Meta 6-7) - acquired from COSMOS sites and Epic Arcs, require high and uncommon skills/materials to manufacture, expensive, traded in small volumes, often equally/little more effective compared to T2s, usually use less CPU/Powergrid/capacitor, same skill requirements as T1s




Deadspace (usually Meta 10-16) - drop as loot in Deadspace complexes (scanned or anomaly escalated DED complexes and final stages of unrated cosmic signature escalations). Among the best modules in the game (together with Officers). Have 4 quality levels (X>A>B>C, X being the best). They are generally expensive but some small, lower tier modules can be bought really cheaply. Same SP requirements as T1s. They are blue in color, so if someone says they have a blue fit, they usually mean full of Deadspace modules.


http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=Deadspace_items  -  names and origins


Officer (usually Meta 13-17) - the most expensive, rarest, prestigious items in the game. They drop from officer rats which are the strongest rats in the game (the best ones requiring supers to kill), spawn in only a few regions and are extremely rare. Some modules don't even have market prices because you just can't find any. They usually sell for at least a billion, but the best versions for popular modules can sell for over 40b. Same SP requirements as T1s. Purple in color so if someone says they have purple modules they mean Officer.




DRONES: 'Excavators'>Geckos>'Subverted'>'Augmented'>Faction>Integrated>T2>T1




Pro Tip: when fitting a ship, check a module, show its info, "Variations" tab, compare tool, throw out items that are too expensive or have no price and compare their stats. Sometimes you can buy a better module for cheaper!
Chapter 7. Missions and LP
Missions are activities, given by agents from different corporations and factions. Rewards for completing those missions are ISK Loyalty Points (LP), and standings. There are security (PVE), mining and distribution (hauling) missions. When people say 'missions' they usually mean security missions, because they are the most popular and profitable. Now back to LP. They are points you can exchange for various unique faction items, ships, implants, BPCs etc. There are 17 factions for which you can do missions. Most of them have more than 1 corporation in it, but they have very similar and often the same items. Only Faction Warfare militias have their own, unique, set of LP items. Those factions are:


* Amarr Empire  [hs/ls]
* Caldari State  [hs/ls]
* Gallente Federation  [hs/ls]
* Minmatar Republic  [hs/ls]


* Ammatar Mandate  [hs/ls]
* Khanid Kingdom  [hs/ls]


* ORE  [ns]
* Sisters of Eve  [hs/ls]
* Thukker Tribe  [hs/ls/ns]
* The Syndicate  [ns]


* Angel Cartel  [ns]
* Guristas Pirates  [ns]
* Serpentis  [ns]
* Sansha's Nation  [ns]
* Blood Raiders  [ns]
* Mordu's Legion  [ns]


* CONCORD  [hs/ls]




1 LP can be worth anywhere from 500 to 3000 ISK. It depends on prices of the items of the faction. On average, you can expect 1200-1500 ISK/LP.




Concord's LP can only be earned through incursions and can be converted to:
* Empire Factions + Ammatar Mandate + Khanid Kingdom  [0.8 RATIO]
* ORE, SoE, Thukker Tribe, The Syndicate  [0.4 RATIO]




Concord's LP cannot be converted to pirate factions

Chapter 10. Politics
As you may or may not know, a lot of things happening in EVE are happening or being influenced because of the politics. If you are a total newbro:

If you wanna catch up or know what is currently going on, check out Jin'taan's channel. Jin'taan is a guy who regularly posts Eve news videos every 2-4 weeks, with a more significant one once every couple of months, where he takes an extensive look around New Eden. Currently his most recent geopolitical video is “The Death of DeadCo” from March.

Chapter 11. Activities
Alright, before I go any further, there is something you should know. Eve is wonderful game and what makes it unique is economy and how we interact and screw each other up not even thinking about it. In the next section you'll read about every activity that brings any reliable profit or fun. You'll read accurate descriptions of the ISK you can expect to make, based on my experience and research. Although this is how the situation looks like at the moment, after I release this guide (provided that actually a lot of people read it) things may change. If you read that salvaging brings very little income and then compare it to Project Discovery which makes a bit more, then you'll likely not choose salvaging. If a lot of you think this way, BANG, people stop salvaging, T1 salvage prices go up, T1 rigs' prices go up, people switch to T2 rigs, demand for T1 rigs drops, prices of T2 rigs also increase because of the increased supply and T2 salvage prices skyrocket. What happens? Exploration and salvaging become much more profitable, generally prices for fully fitted ships go up, because everyone uses rigs, while the market for some less used rigs will collapse because the salvage prices went way up. Well maybe this is a bad example because relic sites give T1 and T2 salvage as well, but you see the point. I'll give you another example: what if enough people read that incursions give amazing income, are safe and fun. Everyone would start training towards their incursion ships. Queue times for guys like WarpToMe can already be very long, especially during prime time. Can you imagine what would happen in 3-5 months time when people would complete their ship training? You'd have to wait hours to just join the fleet. People would start complaining on the forums how incursions are too good and I wouldn't be surprised if CCP decided to nerf them to oblivion. This is the beauty and curse of an open world that Eve has. So, before you get too set on doing this one thing you'd just read about, just because it makes good ISK, read about other things as well, and try a bit of everything. After all it's just a video game not your second job, and you're there to have fun, not make money.




*Also, all training times you'll see are the bare minimum to be able to fly the fit, unless stated otherwise. So you'll probably have to spend a lot more time maximizing your efficiency.

Relic and data sites hacking
Make money exploring. Popular, good ISK activity, especially for new players. Your goal is to get to deep, quiet parts of nullsec, which is arguably the best place to explore, because in highsec or lowsec you make very little money (1-8m per site). In deep null, however, you are not in any real danger (almost no traffic and local), and the loot is amazing (check link below). Generally, relic sites pay way more than data sites, however data sites have a small chance to contain a rare BPC.
To get to deep parts of null, you can go to lowsec first and scan signatures there, you'll find a lot of wormholes which are either a direct null connection or a C1-C3 which is already a good start. The other option is to use Thera, with the help of eve-scout you can get to null fast and safely. After you're there, just visit as many systems as possible and scan the signatures looking for relic/data sites.
After you're done for the day, don't go back to highsec! Instead do a safe logoff and come back the next day, when some sites will respawn. If you're using a cargo scanner and find empty cans, you have to get rid of them as well, otherwise sites won't respawn. You can do that, by actually hacking them or just failing the hack, and they will blow up.
If null exploring is too boring for you, check out WH nomadism chapter, where I talk about WH exploration. It's more dangerous and more luck dependant but if you manage to find a good system you can make a couple of hundred million within a short period of time.

Seeking and mapping wormhole connections
One of the more interesting ways to make money exploring is to find wormhole connections and sell them for ISK. Many FCs will happily accept bookmarks for a chain to enemy space paying you for it and/or giving you a percent of the loot they managed to collect.
If you want to look solely for WHs to enemy space, look for unique and dangerous Drifter Wormholes. There is 5 of them in the entire New Eden, they're guarded by sleepers (you can sneak past them, though) and filled with connections to all regions in the universe. In order to get in one of those, you need to find a system with an "Unidentified Wormhole" in it. They sometimes spawn in systems which have Jove Observatories in them (see link below).
You can enter this wormhole without scanning it down, by warping to the beacon. You'll land ~90km off. You have to have an MWD and/or Cov Ops cloak. If there are sleepers guarding it, wait till they warp away, (they're not gonna attack you unless you start approaching) activitate your prop mod and burn to the WH. If there are no sleepers, watch your overview very carefully, if they appear immediately warp out to any object. If not, enter the wormhole, bookmark the other side, get a safespot and peacefully start scanning the system. Do not sit on any celestial object, otherwise the sleepers will eventually find you and kill you, you need to be in a safespot. After you scan an X amount of wormholes, bookmark them all, one by one, fly to each one of them and check if they lead to nullsec and are not EOL. If so, jump through, check the region and jump back. If you land further than 5.3 km off the WH and there are sleepers, don't jump or NPCs will kill you before you make it. In this situation you sit cloaked until they warp off or you warp off yourself.
If you find an interesting region (depending on your FCs needs) bookmark both entrances and exits and go back. You can now ping that you have found a good wormhole connection. Remember to add that it's a drifter hole.


You can also just explore like you normally do and if you come across a nice WH chain you can still ping it. Generally non drifter wormhole connections are better (live longer, don't require cloak). If all else fails you can always use a spy alt and backprobe from the two desired regions. Now how much can you expect to make? I've seen FCs offering anywhere from 50-120m for a good connection + sometimes a % of the loot. It takes time to scan, however you can hack relic/data sites if you come across any (*not in Drifters). And if you get really lucky and enemy caps were killed using your connection, you can get hundreds of million ISK.  It can be done as Alpha, has very low SP requirements, it's not too difficult but it's fairly random.

Wormhole gas harvesting
Are you a fan of exploration, but you're looking for something a little different? Well, there you have it - ninja gas harvesting. It's something in between relic/data site exploring and mining. Decent profitability, less random, and you can do something else in the meantime. Here is how it works: when doing classic exploration you wanna look for C1-C3 wormholes. When gas harvesting you want to find C5-C6s (which are surprisingly easy to find in nullsec). You can also be doing it in C1-C4s, but gas, that spawns there isn't worth NEARLY as much. When you find a high class wormhole, you want to look for gas signatures.
When you find one, warp in at 50k, check if there are no NPCs. Start up a 15 minute timer - after 15-20 mins sleeper ships will appear and blow you up. Burn towards the gas clouds and start harvesting. In those 15 minutes you can do whatever you want (keep in mind there can be players lurking anywhere), but I especially recommend doing Project Discovery, while spamming DScan. It will be much less risky and you'll make more money. After the 15 minute timer rings, you need to be super careful. Make sure your overview is set up in a way you can see NPC ships.
The moment they appear, stop your gas harvesters and immediately warp out. Warp to another gas site. Rinse and repeat. When full, you can either put it all in a mobile depot (not recommended) or find a K-Space exit. Best ships for this activity are: Venture (alpha friendly) and Prospect (for Omega clones). Check out links below and find what sites give the most profitable gas.


IMPORTANT: Ignore sites named Ordinary Perimeter Reservoir! There are always NPCs there, and they're gonna kill you.




* Est. ISK/h: ~50m/h for the best gas with T1 Venture, ~75m/h with T2 Prospect  + ~35m/h if you choose to do Project Discovery in the meantime
* Training time: 2-5 days for Venture, ~1.5 months for Prospect (Omega training)
* Difficulty: 7/10
* Can be done as Alpha: yes

Ghost data sites
Ghost sites are probably the most exciting exploration activity there is. Those rare, challenging, high risk-high reward data sites leave you with 60-75 seconds to hack as many of the 4 cans as you can. If you fail a hack the site explodes dealing 6-12k damage within 10km radius. If you do not leave the site before the hidden timer runs out, rats warp in, and blow up all the cans themselves, additionally scramming you and dealing you some more damage.
Because of how challenging and uncommon those sites are, you can get some really good loot, if you somehow manage to hack all the containers - 70m-500m, depending on: how many cans you hack, system security and your luck. The hardest, most lucrative, highest explosion damage sites are in wormholes, lowest in highsec. It's recommended to have a T2 data analyzer and a covops cloak. Note, that a good part of the money comes from rare item BPCs, check contracts or production/market cost for estimates on how much ISK they can get you.




* "Lesser" sites in highsec
* "Standard" sites in lowsec
* "Improved" sites in nullsec
* "Superior" sites in wormholes


IMPORTANT: Sites named "Besieged Covert Research Facility", are combat sites, that spawn only in lowsec, not data sites! You'll die if you warp in.




* Est. ISK/h: depends on how many sites can you find, generally you can expect to make 70m-500m per site, if you hack all the cans (low end values for highsec, high end values for W-space)
* Training time: ~2 days for standard Alpha T1 exploration kit,  ~2 months for a decent T2 (with Omega training)
* Difficulty: 9/10
* Can be done as Alpha: yes, but it's very risky, you need as much virus strength/coherence as possible

Nebulae gas harvesting
Make money harvesting K-space gas. It can be found in gas signatures, which first need to be scanned and only appear in certain parts of space. K-space gas is used for the production of boosters. There are 2 main types of gas:


* Mykoserocin, found in high/lowsec, least profitable, used in Synth drug production, which are the cheapest, weakest types of boosters
* Cytoserocin, found in low/nullsec used for standard drug production material, which is then used to manufacture Standard, Improved and Strong types of boosters, much more profitable than mykoserocin.


There are 8 subcategories for each type of gas, each going into a certain type of booster. Each of those types gas types can only be found in 2 constellations in New Eden, 1 Empire and 1 nullsec. Details on: types of gas, names of sites they appear in, boosters they are used to produce and constellations where they appear can be found on UniWiki page (link below).


IMPORTANT: Sites have a chance to deal 800-2000 thermal/EM damage every finished cycle. The chance is higher in null and it's also higher with high value gas sites. Make sure to tank your ship and put some reps on it too. Prospect recommended.


Some sites have NPCs in them. Check UniWiki for specific site information.


K-space gas prices tend to be swing a lot more and the gas itself sells in smaller volumes, when compared to W-space fullerenes. Cytoserocin costs more because it usually appears in null. Mykoserocin is unprofitable, seriously, don't do it.


Usually: mykoserocin<W-space gas except C320<cytoserocin<C320


* Est. ISK/h: 25-60m, depends on the type of gas and if it's Venture/Prospect
* Training time: ~1 week for Venture,   <2 months for Prospect (Omega training)
* Difficulty: 4/10 if in your group's space,  8/10 if not
* Can be done as Alpha: yes

Sleeper Caches
Probably the hardest exploration activity, even harder than ghost data sites. To complete those very rare sleeper caches you need both relic and data analyzers. When inside, you'll encounter various threats like gas sites that constantly deal damage to your ship, sentry towers, traps, explosions and hidden timers. They are very complicated and require certain fittings to succeed. The payout can be sizable though. They can be find in all areas of space, regardless of security. They are the only way to acquire Polarized Weapons BPCs.
Appear in 3 versions:


* Limited Sleeper Cache (easiest)
* Standard Sleeper Cache (medium)
* Superior Sleeper Cache (hardest)


For specific info on what to expect and example fits, see links below.


You'll make 100-200m + BPCs (worth ~10-50m) from the Superior site.






* Training time: 20-30d for Limited, 40-50d for Standard, 20-60d for Superior
* Difficulty: 10/10

Drone hunting
Roam around the galaxy, scooping any expensive drones you come across. Can be done while also exploring for relic/data sites. Basically, you set your DScan to show drones, if you find any expensive, you launch combat probes from your Expanded Probe Launcher and scan them down like any other cosmic signature. Ignore any drones that show a ship scanned next to them.
After you're done, warp to them at 50km, if the grid is clear, burn to them, scoop them, rinse and repeat. It's best done in areas with a high NPC killed in the last 24h (you can check that on Dotlan), Faction Warfare zones or in incursion systems. Works well in highsec, lowsec and nullsec. New player friendly, cheap and disposable fit, and low SP requirements.


Expensive drones (in descending order):


1. 'Excavators' (jackpot)
2. Geckos (very lucky)
3. 'Subverted' (very rare, really expensive)
4. 'Augmented' (lucky)
5. Faction and 'Integrated' (little less common, pretty decent money)
6. T2s (ubiquitous)
7. T1s (not worth your time at all)




* Est. ISK/h: 10m-500m/h, heavily depends on the area and luck
* Training time: 1 day
* Difficulty: 4/10

Silent Battlegrounds
A very rare exploration site, that only appears in Shattered Wormholes. It's hard to scan and once you get there you have a lot of relic and data sites waiting to be hacked (~60). The whole sites gives ~300m ISK in loot. Loot is pretty bulky however (~500m3), so you might not be able to take all of it without expanded cargoholds. There are no NPCs but there is a timer of about 1 hour ticking down and once it's finished, all the remaining cans blow up. Your ship won't take any damage though. If you find a site like that, you should bring friends, because alone, you won't be able to hack a large part of those containers in time.








































































POS hunting
Look for offline structures of inactive corporations, wardec them, destroy the POS and take any loot that was in there. Sometimes you won't find anything valuable, but other times you can get billions in loot.
It takes a lot of time bashing (often hours if solo) but it usually pays off. You don't have to wardec if you don't do it in highsec but it's a lot more dangerous (however it's more profitable too). For bashing ships use Oracle/Talos/Ishtar/Revelation (Revelation can't fly into highsec) or anything big enough that uses lasers and/or drones. If you're doing it in a wormhole, it's best to bring bombers though. To check if a corporation is inactive, check their zKillboard and compare it to the number of members.




* ISK/h: ??? (heavily luck dependant)
* Training time:  ~  2m (Oracle)/4m (Talos)/6m (Ishtar)/9m (Revelation) [Omega training]
* Difficulty: 3/10
* Can be done as Alpha: no

Wormhole nomadism
If you enjoy adventures and want to take a step further in your explorer's career, you can choose to live a nomadic lifestyle in J-Space. You never settle down, travel through more and more wormholes without ever going back, while grabbing all the loot on the way. You can do it as a pure explorer, gas harvester, cloaky roamer, ratter - anything! Requires good scanning skills or an alt. After you're done for the day, you never go back to K-Space, you just warp to a safespot and log off.


If you want to be an explorer, you can do it with 1-3 days training, for a T1 exploration frigate (Heron, Imicus, Magnate, Probe). If you want to take it a step further you train for an Astero or for a Cov Ops ship (T2 exploration frigate). More info on that below.
You can expect to make very decent money this way, obviously the better the ship the faster you scan and the better ISK/h. It's kinda luck dependant though. You can go through many, many systems without finding a pirate relic or data site, and then find one system which has like 15. You can expect the same kind of loot as in nullsec. You NEVER warp in to sites that start with Unsecured or Forgotten, those are combat sites with data/relic cans. You will only find the pirate exploration sites in C1-C3s and in shattered C4s. Depending on your luck you can make 40-160m ISK/h. It can be done as Alpha. Difficulty 5/10. Training time is ~1 month for an Astero and 1-3 months for Covert Ops (Omega training, so 2x speed).

*Keep in mind, maxing your scanning skills (strength, deviation and time), using faction probes and probe launchers and scanning implants can significantly increase your ISK/h.

MTU scanning/hunting
Make money combat scanning abandoned MTUs, destroying them and taking the loot. Can be done in highsec. It isn't really a lucrative activity and your ISK/h can be easily surpassed by almost anything else, but it's there for good measure. If you're interested, but discouraged by low ISK/h, try MTU suspect baiting which makes significantly more money (you bait ships into attacking you when you have a suspect flag after agressing their MTUs). Check the respective chapter for more info.

Thera transport/exploration
Thera is a huge wormhole system, with NPC stations and connections to all parts of space. And thanks to the work of Signal Cartel and their eve-scout website, those wormhole connections from Thera are being regularly checked and put on their site, for everyone to use. This way you don't have to scan every single signature, you just check the destination system and the entrance/exit ID, and then scan that (or use the new bookmark system, this way you won’t even have to scan!). 


Now, if you've played Eve for some time, you probably know that literally anything can be used to your advantage. Thera is no different. If you're an explorer, you can quickly and safely get to the deep parts of null. If you're an opportunistic trader, you can undock your Blockade Runner/DST and do trips, importing and exporting stuff for your alliance or for yourself, or trade all the cheap stuff you can find in null NPC stations either via market or contracts. If you're a combat guy, you can use it to roam to enemy space or camp one of the 4 Thera stations. You can even import and manufacture stuff and sell them right there, inside Thera. The are corporations that live there as well, most notably Signal Cartel, so if you're looking for a group, there's that too.




* Est. ISK/h: depends on the activity
* Training time: 1-2 days for exploration, usually weeks/months for industry, ~2 months for Blockade Runner/DST
* Difficulty: 2/10 if you don't use stations, 8/10 if you do

Salvaging
The classic salvaging (some call it ninja salvaging but the true ninja salvaging/looting will be described later in the guide), is a decent way to make money for a new player. You jump in a destroyer, fit salvagers and optionally tractor beams and just salvage all the NPC wrecks you can find. There are 3 legit ways to do it:


1. Nullsec block: a safe and probably the most efficient option (in my opinion?) - you join a big nullsec alliance, jump in a system where a lot of your allies rat, bookmark all the combat sites and warp to them once they disappear from your anomaly scanner (which means they've been completed), rinse and repeat; pretty safe because you have eyes, intel, standing fleets etc. to make sure you're safe


2. Incursions: follow incursioners (by DScanning, combat probing or asking in local) and salvage all the Sansha wrecks after they're done, even safer than a), but less ISK/h


3. Buddy missioning: have a friend that runs highsec security sites and gives you BMs or lets you warp in to salvage, as safe as b), similar money to a)


You can also look for some PVEers in null without joining a null block but it's way, way more dangerous.

Incursions
High class, lucrative PVE activity, where a group of 30-40 players run sites in a constellation invaded by Sansha pirates. They last for a couple of days, and after they are defeated (mothership killed), they spawn somewhere else in space, often after a day or two of delay. 


Very good payout, in fact, it's one of the most profitable activities in highsec. They increase your security status, are fun and not grindy. Unfortunately Incursion ships are very expensive (500m+) and have high skill requirements. Incursions appear both in highsec and lowsec/null. The latter ones pay ~50% more but are much more dangerous, while highsec incursions are said to be one of the safest activities in the game. There are certain, very well organized groups who specialize in Incursions, most notably WarpToMe.
Keep in mind, because of how popular Incursions are, you’ll usually have to sit some time in the waitlist before they let you join (sometimes a long time too, waiting 30+ min is not uncommon).






* Est. ISK/h: 180/200m in highsec,  250-300m in low/null

Abyssals
Fun and challenging PVE activity. You can do it solo - in a cruiser or above, or you can do it in a fleet of 3 frigates. You fight in dangerous abyssal space, where if you stray off too far, you quickly die from the effects of environment. NPCs are well equipped with webs, neuts, EWAR, local and remote reps. In order to get into the Abyss you need to use a filament (or 3 if you do this in fleet). You have 20 minutes to complete the site then it closes and you die, although on average it takes 15-17mins.
You can do this in all areas of space and no player can join you or disturb you once you're in the abyss. The place where you come out from is visible on the overview of all players and warpable. There are 5 types of filaments each having 5 levels of difficulty. Each type of filament has a certain boost and a certain penalty to your ship characteristics:


* Calm - Tier 1 (the easiest)
* Agitated - Tier 2
* Fierce - Tier 3
* Raging - Tier 4
* Chaotic - Tier 5 (the hardest)




Dark - penalty to optimal and falloff turret range, 50% bonus to velocity
Exotic - penalty to kinetic resist, 50% bonus to scan resolution
Gamma - penalty to explosive resist, 50% bonus to shield HP
Electrical - penalty to EM resist, bonus to capacitor recharage
Firestorm - penalty to thermal resist, 50% bonus to armor HP


These are the estimated DPS numbers to complete the site within 20 minutes, both solo and in fleet:


* T1 150 dps total 
* T2 230 dps total
* T3 350 dps total
* T4 500 dps total
* T5 660 dps total


When you complete these in fleet, you get 2-3x the normal loot, so you can multibox it easily. Just remember you can ONLY do it in frigates.


Average ISK/h:


* T1 pay ~20m/h per toon
* T2 pay ~60m/h per toon
* T3 pay ~100m/h per toon
* T4 pay ~200/h per toon
* T5 pay ~350/h per toon 


Keep in mind T4s are pretty challenging and T5s are very hard to complete, even with a good fit and DPS you'll sometimes die. Loot consists of red loot (sold to NPC buy orders), abyssal materials for industry, different filaments, mutaplasmids (permanent, random modifications for certain modules), precursor skillbooks and abyssal BPCs. Mutaplasmid types depend on the type of filament:


* Dark - propulsion modules
* Firestorm - armor related 
* Electrical - capacitor related
* Gamma - shield related
* Exotic - tackle related


In terms of demand: Dark>Electrical>Exotic>Firestorm>Gamma


Good ships: Kestrel, Hookbill, Hawk, Gila, Retribution


* Training time: ~3 days T1/T2 Kestrel, ~2,5 months for a very well trained T4-T5 Hookbill/Hawk, much less for T3s (~1,5 months) [Omega training]
* Difficulty: 7/10
* Can be done as Alpha: yes

Combat anomalies
This is where 80% of ratting happens. You can warp to them immediately so you don't have to spend time scanning, they are all over the place, they're a very reliable source of income, most ISK comes from bounty payments so you don't have to haul loot (although many people choose to leave MTUs).
It's usually done in null because it's safe and the income is significantly bigger when compared to lowsec/highsec. The sites you wanna run (in ascending difficulty) are: Forsaken Rally Point, Forsaken Hub and Rock Haven. To tell if Haven is a rock one, you initiate warp, cancel it and check if Aura notification pops up. If it does, it is a Rock Haven. While ratting, there is a small chance for a faction ship to spawn, which, if you're lucky, can give you some really nice loot, however they usually only drop ammo/tags. Combat anomalies also have a chance to escalate (~5%).


You shouldn't really rat anomalies in highsec, it's just not worth your time. And when you're in lowsec you're better off doing it in belts.


Some good ships: Myrmidon, Dominix, Oracle, Harbinger (*Navy Issue), Gila, carriers, supercarriers. You should avoid using dreadnoughts, because, to be effective, they need to be using a siege module.


Combat anomaly ratting income is usually stated in ticks, each tick is 20 minutes (every 20 minutes you get bounty payments).


IMPORTANT: there is also a tiny chance for an NPC dreadnought to spawn in the final wave, they won't tackle you but they will blow you up easily. If it does spawn, immediately warp away. Killing them gives a lot of money, but you need a well fit dreadnought or a super to do that.




* Est. ISK/h (null): 50-80m/h for subcaps 120-210m for carriers, 240-350m for supers
* Training time:  1-3,5m for subcaps   9-12m for carriers and supercarriers        [Omega training]

Belt ratting
Kill the NPCs in asteroid belts. Done mostly for rare spawns because raw ISK/h isn't that great. You either do it in lowsec or in nullsec.


In lowsec you do it purely for the rare spawns, because bounties are pretty bad. You're looking for: Clone Soldiers, Mordu's Ships, faction spawns.
Clone soldiers are tanky NPCs that only spawn in lowsec. They have a 100% chance to drop a clone soldier tag which, if you give it back in a Concord office you get some security status back. They are only worth doing in 0.1-0.2 systems, where the tags are worth ~15/25m. The more valuable once obviously drop in 0.1, but those rats are a bit harder to kill and have scrams/webs.
The other rare spawn is a faction ship, they have decent bounties but you do it for the possibly amazing loot, which is pirate faction items. They can be worth anywhere from a couple of hundred thousand to billions. They also have a very tiny chance to drop a pirate ship BPC.
The third type of NPCs you can encounter are very rare Mordu's ships. Once killed they always drop a 1 run BPC of the ship they were flying. They have 3 ships: Garmur (frigate, ~45m BP), Orthrus (cruiser, ~210m BP) and Barghest (battleship ~550m BP). The bigger their ship, the harder it is to kill, with the battleship requiring over 800 DPS to kill.


In nullsec, you also want to look for rare spawns which are: NPC Dreadnoughts, hauler spawns, officer spawns and also faction spawns. Dreads require an enormous amount of DPS to kill and tank and can actually warp off, done in small groups (~3-7 people usually). The normal one has a 60m bounty and no loot and the elite (faction) one has a 120m bounty and a stash of rare loot.
Hauler spawns are industrials which drop a LOT of minerals, worth possibly hundreds of millions when killed. The harder the hauler is to kill, the more expensive mineral will it drop. You're gonna need a hauler docked nearby to scoop the minerals.
Faction spawns - these are very similar to lowsec, maybe the loot is a bit better. Officers are the final bosses of ratting. They only spawn in NPC null, in truesec between -1.0 and -0.7. They have an incredibly small chance to spawn (~0.001%) and drop modules worth billions or even tens of billions. The best officer spawns require multiple capitals to kill but they drop the best modules too.


There is ~2-3% chance for a special spawn. The lower the truesec, the better NPCs you'll encounter (generally).
If you find a faction spawn and you don't kill all the rats that spawned in that belt (leave a frigate), the entire spawn should respawn.


NPCs in asteroid belts respawn after 20-30min.
Some good ships: Vexor, Catalyst, Cynabal, Myrmidon






* Est. ISK/h: 15-25m without any special spawns
* Training time: 0.5-3 months (Omega training)
* Difficulty: 7/10 in lowsec, 5/10 in nullsec
* Can be done as Alpha: yes, to an extent












































































Highsec/lowsec security missions
Security missions are missions you take from NPC agents, kill NPCs in the bookmarked location for money and LP, and if you want, loot and salvage as well. There are highsec/lowsec missions (empire/khanid/ammatar/thukker/SoE corps) and nullsec pilots (pirate, ORE, Mordus, Syndicate).


Generally:


* Level 1 - frigates
* Level 2 - cruisers
* Level 3 - battlecruisers
* Level 4 - T2 fitted battleships
* Level 5 - T3 cruisers, carriers or a group of players including logis


Agent/corporation/faction standings you need to start a mission


* Level 1: -2.00 or higher
* Level 2: 1.00 or higher
* Level 3: 3.00 or higher
* Level 4: 5.00 or higher
* Level 5: 7.00 or higher


Level 4 and level 5 missions cannot be done by Alpha clones.
For every 16th completed mission of the same level and faction you get a storyline mission. When you complete it you get a big boost to the agent's corporation standings and a decent boost to empire standings (which is useful for decreasing taxes).


When you do missions (or generally kill rats), your security status increases.






Quick disclaimer, missions up to L4 aren't really worth your time. It takes a ton of time to get to L4 (where it's at least somewhat profitable) and the rewards are usually still smaller than nullsec anomaly ratting. On top of that training time can be very long.


The only good money you can make is from L5 missions, which are always located in lowsec, with a carrier (like Thanatos). To do them you need a well trained carrier pilot for high efficiency and 1-2 faction pullers with 7.00 empire standings, that let you decline missions that are not blitzable without any real penalties. When you find a good mission, you accept it and warp your faction puller together with your carrier to it. The carrier then blitzes the mission. Rinse and repeat. Doing that you can achieve 600m-1,3b ISK per hour, however: it takes a long training for a carrier, a bit of work to get your faction standings high enough + lowsec can be dangerous. If you're still interested, there's a link to a guide below (to see how to get your standings up quickly scroll down the comments).




If you like the concept of missions but are discouraged by the low ISK, check “Burner missions” chapter.




* Est. ISK/h: ~50m/h for L4, up to 1,3b/h if you to go hardcore with the L5s  (remember you need to then convert the LP!)
* Training time: usually around 3 months for L4,   9-12 months for carriers
* Difficulty: 2/10 highsec  8/10 lowsec
* Can be done as Alpha: up to L3

Nullsec missions
Do security missions for pirates, in nullsec. They pay a bit more than highsec missions but have a few disadvantages. First of all, to get the good ones you have to grind your standings up. You do that with Cosmos missions and epic arcs. Then you should have access to L4 security missions. Pirate agents are only located in the NPC null region of that faction, which are:


* Venal (Guristas)
* Stain (Sanshas)
* Curse (Angels)
* Delve (Blood Raiders)
* Serpentis (Fountain)
* Syndicate (The Syndicate)
* Outer Ring (ORE)
* Great Wildlands (Thukker Tribe)


If you want to try and do pirate missions then here are a couple of important things you should know:
* if you get your pirate standings up, your empire standings will go down, and you will be locked out of highsec, so prepare an alt
* some NPC null regions can be a real wild west, with bubbles, gangs and combat probers waiting to kill you everywhere
* you need a T3 cruiser to run them efficiently (Tengu, Loki)
* you need very good (in-game) social skills to increase your standings gains and LP




Again, if you like the concept of security missions, but want more money, check out burner missions, which can be farmed very profitably, both in highsec/lowsec and in nullsec.






* Est. ISK/h: maybe ~100m/h
* Training time: ~3 months for T3C, + ~1 month for decent social skills
* Difficulty: 8/10
* Can be done as Alpha: no


















Wormhole ratting
Ratting in wormholes is much more dangerous and requires very expensive, well fit ships but it can bring a ton of ISK. The high class PVE activities (C4+) are often done in groups, but there are mad lads that do it solo, there had even been a guy that would make 2b ISK/h farming a C6 in a Naglfar.
The money you get is blue loot, that you need to haul out of the wormhole and sell to NPC buy orders. You can get some bonus ISK for salvaging too. There are a lot of ships you can use, like: Rattlesnake, Gila, Gnosis, Paladin, Vargur or capital ships.
If you are going to farm anything higher than a C3, it's best to join a corporation that lives in your wormhole type, you don't have to do the sites together, it's just for the safety. For the actual sites, there is an amazing Google document with the specifics, DPS and tank in all wormhole sites that have any PVE combat, (check the link below).






* Est. ISK/h: check Google doc
* Training time: 1,5-2,5 months for subcaps ~7-8 months for Marauders, little more for caps (depends on the fit though)
* Difficulty: 8/10 (you need to be really careful)
* Can be done as Alpha: probably, but not really higher than in a C2

NPC ore miners hunting
Have you ever noticed those weird mining ships, with a faction name and a little crystal in the ship type? Well those are NPC mining ops. You can kill them legally, even in highsec. Doing so makes you lose standing with them, if you manage to kill one of their hauling ships which take their ore, you get a joint box and some rocks, (which are never really worth taking).
The joint box however is where the money's at. If you open it you have a ~93% chance to get a mining ship skin, most of them aren't worth very much, but a Bowhead/Orca skin can be pretty decent money. What you're really after though, is the other 7% - you can get Elara/Carpo/Aoede Mining Laser Upgrades and Harvester Mining Drones. The chances of getting each of those rare items are roughly equal, while the prices aren't:


* Elara MLU is the least expensive of the 4: ~20m/pc
* then comes Carpo MLU at ~80m/pc
* followed by Aoede MLU and Harvester Drones at - ~450m/pc
There is also a very small chance for the hauler to drop one of those mining laser upgrades as well.


The data is borrowed from a video of a guy named Minchurra, link below. If you put it all together, at current prices it can give you ~180m/h income, if you hunt those miners efficiently. The best ship for the job is a T3 destroyer with as much raw DPS as possible, warp scrambler and potentially a webifier, combat probes and a propulsion module. Link to the 2 hunting guides below.
Things to note:
* Defense fleet has no loot
* Mining ships do not have loot - only rocks
* T2 ships have expensive salvage but are hard to kill


Fun fact: when you have high standings with a certain faction their ships will rep you when you're in danger


* Est. ISK/h: ~180m, which is NOT reliable income: you'll get many cheap skins to then get a very expensive 0,5b drone, however on a large enough scale this is the profit it should bring
* Training time: ~2 months for decent skills
* Difficulty: 8/10
* Can be done as Alpha: no

Triglavian Conduits
A relatively new, highsec PVE activity, introduced in May 2019. From now on, Triglavians will invade a couple of constellations across highsec. They will roam around the systems, attacking player ships and Upwell structures, or even camp gates. They hang around in deep space or on celestials and if you enter combat with them they can even call for reinforcements.
However this is not what makes you the most ISK. In those systems you can find conduits, which are similar to incursions. They are combat pockets for a small group of pilots (3-15, depending on the type of the complex). When you complete them, you get a small amount of ISK and DED LP (which is usually very expensive, 2500 ISK/LP easily) and access to very expensive loot and salvage. 
You can make very good ISK doing them - ~140m/h for each pilot, however the sites are usually pretty hard, with NPCs having all sorts of nasty stuff (EWAR, strong remote reps, scrams, webs, neuts) and require a good team composition. If you bring more pilots than the limit, the payout won't increase and will be split evenly between all people. You can find details on UniWiki (link below).
Also, invaded systems can have strong effects on ships. You can find them on UniWiki as well.


Another type of new, Triglavian activity, are Emerging Conduits. Those quick to run anomalies appear all over highsec, and have 3 waves of Triglavian NPCs. You can complete them in ~6 mins. They pay 4,5m and 300LP for each pilot up to 3, then the payout is split. The sites respawn after 10 minutes. Salvage and loot can be very good too, especially from the Zorya Vedmak. It's recommended to chain run them with 3 of your accounts, one of them being a salvager/looter, for the maximum payout.
Also, Orca can be a great salvager, it has 6 high slots, and you can find some good rocks in those sites too.
As of 28 Jan 2020, Emerging Conduits sites received a heavy nerf, (they used to respawn in 1 minute), you can expect to make ~100m/h doing them right now (estimated, I haven’t tried them post-nerf yet).
*Zorya Vedmak will warp off if you leave him to be the last ship. And he can have very good loot, so don't do that.


Some good ships: Praxis, Vindicator, Dominix, Rattlesnake or even T3C


* Training time: 0,5-4 months (Omega training)
* Difficulty: 4/10 Emerging,  7/10 the ones in invaded systems
* Can be done as Alpha:  yes

Burner missions
Burner missions are one of the most lucrative PVE activities. When you do L4 missions you have a chance to get a burner, an optional, exceptionally hard mission, that you will get no penalty for declining. In those missions you face 1 or 3 (team missions) very strong pirate frigates. Their strength is the equivalent of a player with perfect skills, faction modules, implants and on drugs.


To complete them successfully and efficiently you require very blingy fits and very high skills. Burners are usually limited to frigates. The rewards you get are very high: 12-14k LP and 5-6 million ISK, for the faction you are doing missions for (usually SoE because the exchange rates are very good). Normally this wouldn't be very appealing, because you only have a small chance to get the mission for which you need specific fits, but luckily people had come up with a way to blitz them.




The only thing you need (other than very long training time and a lot of ISK spent on ships) is to grind up your faction standings to a little more than 5.00. You do this by doing COSMOS and Storyline (every 16th normal mission) missions. This can take some time and it's rather tedious. This way you'll be able to cherry pick burners and complete them in 6-10 mins (warp times included). More info on how it works in guides below.


The training takes about a year, and you'll need about 10b to get all the ships (you don't know which burner you'll have to deal with). When you master burner blitzing you can make a whopping 280-400m/h, in highsec.


Pro tip: The lower the system security, the better the payout.




* Est. ISK/h: 280-400m/h
* Training time: ~1 year
* Difficulty: 8/10
* Can be done as Alpha: no

Escalations
Make money doing escalations. There are 2 types of escalations: DED rated (which are very similar to scanned DED rated signature sites), and expeditions, which are scripted sets of events, with NPC fights in 4 different systems. 
Each of those locations have a 1 stronger NPC which always drops something valuable - you have a chance to get faction modules or deadspace modules (the higher the level of the site the higher tier of the items), or at least faction tags and/or faction ammo. In drone regions you get either drone components or Sentient modules (which are drone faction modules). You only have 24 hours to complete an escalation and they tend to be pretty lucrative.


You have a ~5% chance to get a DED rated escalation from completing combat anomalies.
You have a ~5% chance to get an expedition from completing unrated cosmic signature sites.


The fits depend a lot on the region and level on the site, so I won't be giving you any specific ships or fits. There are however many you can find online or if you're completely lost you can always ask on forums.








* Est. ISK/h: very hard to estimate, depends on your luck in getting escalations/expeditions and if NPCs drop faction loot, but if you do get some escalations/expeditions, it's generally pretty good
* Training time: a couple of months, usually
* Difficulty: 4/10
* Can be done as Alpha: the low level ones - yes
* Links that might interest you:




* https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Combat_sites  -  you can find info on specific sites






















Unrated signature combat sites
Rat in previously scanned combat sites. They pay less than a DED complex but they may escalate into an expedition. You are harder to catch than if you were anomaly ratting. In unrated combat sites you'll encounter a faction NPC, which has a chance to drop some expensive stuff. Usually, they are also much easier than DEDs so you can use DED chapter for reference.


Also, you should really use a scanning alt for finding them.




* Est. ISK/h: they are easier to find than DEDs,  ISK/site (in the long run) is higher than in anomalies but lower than in DEDs, however if you rat anomalies you don't have to scan at all;  after all, it's probably a bit better than combat anomalies
* Training time: 3 weeks - 4 months
* Difficulty: very easy in highsec,  hard in lowsec,  medium in null
* Can be done as Alpha: yes
* Links that might interest you:

DED rated sites
DED rated complexes are uncommon, lucrative PVE activities. They range from 1-10 levels, 10th being the hardest. You can either find them by scanning (cosmic signatures) or you have a small chance (~5%) to receive them as an escalation from combat anomalies. 
For the rewards - you have a 100% chance to get an Overseer's Personal Effects, which work like sleeper or abyssal loot, you sell them to NPC buy orders. On top of that you have a minor chance to get a deadspace/faction item(s) and a very small chance to get a pirate faction ship BPC which can make you a ton of ISK. The higher the level the better the ship BPC (bigger, therefore more expensive).


There are size limitations to every complex. Maximum sizes allowed are:


* 1/10           Frigate class
* 2/10           Destroyer class (including T3)
* 3/10           Cruiser class (except for T3 cruiser)
* 4/10           Battlecruiser class (except for T3 Cruiser)
* 5-10/10   Battleship class and T3 Cruiser


DED complexes do not escalate.




For the ships/fits you can fight in, I suggest you watch a very good Guristas all DED sites series by Minchurra (link below). For other pirate factions just check what's their damage type and adjust the resistances accordingly. You might want to test it on SiSi beforehand though. Also, if you're planning to rat in Guristas space, the videos will also show you the optimal way to complete the site.






* Est. ISK/h: very hard to estimate, depends on the amount of sites you find and if you get lucky with the loot drops, but on the ISK/site compared to anomalies and unrated sites, in the long run, DEDs are the best
* Training time: 1-5 months
* Difficulty: 4/10
* Can be done as Alpha: yes

Chemical labs
Chemical Labs, is one of PVE activities available in New Eden, and not a very well documented one. They only spawn in lowsec and nullsec. They are cosmic signatures and after being scanned down they show up as gas sites. There is also extra stuff hidden in encrypted containers, you need a data analyzer to access it. 
After all, the loot is generally: drug skillbooks and BPCs, reaction formulas and drug commodities. You can then put the BPCs and reaction formulas on the market or use them for your own booster production chain. The strong drug BPCs can sell for hundreds of millions, but the sites they appear in are generally well protected. You can find some details about those sites on UniWiki.

COSMOS sites
COSMOS missions are special chains of PVE missions where you learn about the lore while getting storyline item BPCs, rare faction ships BPCs and increasing your standings. All COSMOS missions can only be completed once. Don't talk to an agent unless you are planning to do it, or the offer will eventually expire. 
There are 4 levels of mission, most of them require certain faction standings, but you can get them as you progress. There are all sorts of different missions: encounter (classic PVE combat), delivery or even complexes (where you warp to a static beacon or signature that needs to be scanned). 
Some missions require certain items, which can be bought on the market or acquired from static complexes.


Static complexes are required to complete some missions (as you've just read), but they can also be run just for loot, without doing COSMOS stuff. The loot isn't that great and it's mostly mission stuff, but in some complexes you can get something nice (you can check that on UniWiki). The complexes respawn after some time, always in the same system. But sometimes they are just landmarks.


Standings requirements:
* L1: no requirements
* L2: 2.00 faction standings
* L3: 4.00 faction standings
* L4: 6.00 faction standings


As a rule of thumb bring:
* L1: destroyers
* L2: cruisers
* L3: battlecruisers
* L4: battleships


COSMOS missions are usually done purely for the standings, the loot is just a bonus.
You can get more specific info on UniWiki (link below).


* Training time: <1 week for destroyers, <3 weeks for cruisers, <6 weeks for battlecruisers, <3 months for battleships
* Difficulty: 3/10
* Can be done as Alpha: yes

Epic Arcs
Epic Arcs are faction specific, scripted missions with unique, fixed rewards. There is 7 of them: 1x Sisters of EvE,  4x Empire Faction,  2x Pirate (Angel and Guristas). You can do each mission once every 3 months. Each of those missions consist of many small 'quests'. The objective of each of those quests can be to: kill NPCs (encounter), haul (courier) or to just travel. 
Sisters of Eve is the most newbro friendly Epic Arc, it's also the longest one. It can be completed in a destroyer. It consists of 51 missions. They pay 200-400k per mission, with the last one giving 1m and a 7% boost to the standing of previously selected faction.
Empire faction missions is where the fun starts. NPCs here are much, much stronger compared to SoE's (L4 missions level), you will sometimes have to haul through lowsec/nullsec but the rewards are much better: 1-50m (depending on faction and how hard the mission was), especially the ones for completing the final mission such as: faction standing increase (either empire or pirate), and items worth 75-800m ISK. 
Pirate faction missions are much easier compared to empire Epic Arcs but they are more dangerous because they take place in null. For the rewards, you get: massive pirate faction standing increase, 4-10m per mission + items worth 200-300m.


You can find details about every single quest of those missions, rewards, tactics and sometimes also fits, on UniWiki (link below).




NOTE: you need level 3 (for pirates) or level 4 (empires) standings level with a particular faction to start the Epic Arc




* Est. ISK/h: more than L4 missions, but less than incursions and high level null ratting (but also standings boost)
* Training time: ~1 week for SoE and pirate   2,5-4 months for empires [Omega training]
* Difficulty: 6/10
* Can be done as Alpha: SoE and pirate factions - yes,  empire - probably not

Besieged Covert Research Facilities
A combat anomaly that only appears in lowsec. There are 2 waves of enemies, in cruisers/battleships, with scrams, webs and high range. To complete the site it's good to have a ship with high range (+100km). Recommended ships are: Ishtar, T3 cruisers, Amarr battleships with sniper ammo, Gilas. The sites are pretty quick to run, usually 7-10 mins. The average loot is 10-30m but you have a chance to hit a jackpot (Virtue implants, pirate ships BPCs, Prototype Hyperspatial Economizer BPCs) worth hundreds of millions or even billions. 
Generally it's a decent ISK/h with a small chance for some rare stuff. If you want to do it, find a quiet part of lowsec, otherwise you'll regularly get killed, since it's a combat anomaly anyone can warp to.


Note: loot drops from Guristas Research Hub and Thukker Lab/Facility




* Est. ISK/h: 50-220m
* Training time: ~1,5/3/5 months
* Difficulty: 4/10

Faction Warfare missions
No longer a thing, at least for now. Faction Warfare missions had been giving so much free LP that the faction item prices crashed and players farmed instead of actually fighting. Which is why, a while back, a coalition of FW corps, from both sides of Amarr-Minmatar warzone (where the best missions and agents are/were) signed an agreement and locked each other from agents systems to prevent any mission farming taking place. 
About a month or so later, CCP announced FW changes, at Eve Vegas, inspired by what those guys had done and the changes they had proposed. And with the new patch which rolled in on 24th of March 2020, they also received a significant nerf (30% less LP).

Suicide ganking
Kill high value ships in highsec before Condord shows up. Done either for profit or for a nice killboard. There are 4 ways to do this.


1. Low tier ganking - capsules with implants, shuttles, T1 frigates - usually done with a Thrasher (1-2k alpha strike)
2. Miner ganking - usually done with a certain amount of Catalysts (pure DPS)
3. Industrial ganking - anything from T1 industrials to freighters - can be done in a lot of ships like Catalyst, Maller, Moa, Vexor, Tornado, Brutix, Gnosis, Thorax etc. (high DPS and tank for gate guns)
4. Blingy ships ganking - ships that are expensive and have expensive modules like Gila, Rattlesnake - you can gank them with the same ships industrials are ganked with (high DPS and tank for gate guns)


To actually profit from this, you need to have at least 1 alt or a friend, so it can't be done solo as an Alpha clone (you need to do things like scan ship/cargo, gank and take loot in a short amount of time). However if you're there only for the killboard you can gank expensive capsules (like the infamous Aaaarrgg) with only 1 character. The bigger the ship the more gankers are required to take him down, with a jump freighter requiring the most resources to successfully gank (over 30 T2 Catalysts in 0.5). 
Ganking is complicated and requires you to PLEX 2 accounts if you want to do it solo, however you can make a ton of money, with hundreds of billions passing through highsec everyday, people autopiloting despite having expensive cargo and T1 industrials with billions in items on board. You need to be patient and quick to react when you notice someone worth ganking. Unless you choose to gank miners, they are easy to gank but give very little in profits.


"CODE." alliance is particularly (in)famous for ganking, they even offer SRP to some degree.

Mercenaries
Join a team of mercenaries that are paid to kill and destroy. Not only can they help you win fights, but also assault systems, bash/protect structures, gather intel or even get better at PVP. Right now, it's safe to say Noir. leads the charge as being the most renowned reliable and professional mercenary group. To find out more, I approached Andy Astronaut, one of Noir.'s recruiters, to ask a couple of questions:




What does it take to join you? Do you accept inexperienced players?


Andy Astronaut: In general, we're looking for people with small gang PvP experience. We're not only looking for elite players, there's definitely room to grow, but our playstyle usually revolves around few vs. many, so we fly a lot of specialized ships. That being said, we also have had in the past, and are rebooting Noir. Academy, which is a program for teaching inexperienced players how to fight in small gangs and how to be mercenaries.




Do you have any SP requirements?


Andy Astronaut: For corp we don't have any specific SP or XX kill requirements. We roam with potential new members and assess on a case by case basis. And for Noir. academy we have no requirements other than enthusiasm to learn/interest in PvP.




Do you need to be able to fly an alt?


Andy Astronaut: Nope, alts are always helpful, but having alts and/or dual boxing aren't expected or required




How much, on average, do your services cost?


Andy Astronaut: That's a question I don't actually have an answer to. Contracts can vary widely, because we take so many different kinds of them, and the targets can vary widely as well. Even just a structure bash could be against a small 10 man corp or a 100 man alliance. All the contracts go through our CEO Alekseyev Karrde, so feel free to ask him.




How much, on average, can you make as a Noir member?


Andy Astronaut: Yeah, so that's again highly variable. I would say, that for most people it's not enough to entirely sustain your gameplay, but it is enough to make it worth our time. Payouts are split between people that actively participated with "MVP's" for various roles also getting bonuses for performance.






Big thanks to Andy for his help. If you have any more questions, and/or if you're interested in being part of Noir., join their in-game chat channel - Cafe Noir. which you can find the link to in the description of Noir. corporation.

Faction Warfare
PVP activity that can be both fun and rewarding. You take over or defend an outpost by being there for 10-20 mins. There are 2 sets of 2 factions that are always at war with each other: Caldari vs. Gallente  and  Amarr vs. Minmatar. Before you take part you need to enlist for 1 of the factions. This means you can shoot and be shot everywhere, even in highsec. The money comes in the form of LP which is then exchanged at LP stores for items (usually at an exchange 800-2000 ISK/LP depending on who's winning and how much time will you spend hauling/trading/waiting) You can make money in 2 ways:


* Defensive plexing*, which is tedious and designed for the lazy/risk averse: in theory, you should sit in a complex and wait for an enemy to show up and then fight them, in practice, you usually fit warp core stabs, sit in the open complex and warp off when an enemy shows up, this activity gives 25% less money (LP) that offensive plexing


* Offensive plexing, which is you actively fighting against the NPC that is in a complex and then a player if one shows up, it gives higher rewards, especially if you kill players doing this, much more exciting and gives good content


*Plex means faction warfare complex. PLEX is Eve's premium currency.


The bigger the complex you capture/defend the more LP you get. Also, the higher the tier of your faction (depends on number of held systems) the more or less LP you get.
You also get LP for killing ships of enemy militias, the bigger the killmail the more LP you get. LP you get from kills isn’t modified by your faction tier.


Also, it’s worth noting, that with the new update, you get a suspect flag, if you enter a complex, when you’re not part of either of the fighting factions militia.


When you are looking to convert LP into ISK, it's best to wait for your faction to drop level. When that happens, people get less LP and prices go up.




Alpha clones have a very good chance in FW, with the complexes size restrictions, but if you choose offensive plexing it's highly recommended to join a corporation and fly with them in group, on comms. The reason for that is 1) experienced players having edge over you in a 1v1 fight, because they often fly faction/pirate frigates with maxed out skills + the game experience bonus  2) numbers advantage   3) more fun


Even as Alpha you can enlist from day 1 and some basic ships only take a couple of days to train into. Just don't do it with your main account because when you enter the empire of the opposing faction, faction navy will start chasing you. And that can really hurt your trading, manufacturing and hauling capabilities.


With the help of the free 250k SP you get, when creating an account with a referral, you can fly a variety of fits from day 1, and even more after some training.
* Est. LP/h: depends on the complex size, faction tier, enemies killed, contested %, etc. you can definitely make 100k LP, both defensive and offensive if conditions are right, on average it's closer to 50k and 30k with novice complexes

Fun fact: many years ago there was a group of players who successfully exploited Eve's FW LP system. They would buy a lot of one item, manipulate its prices and then blow their own ships up, getting them huge amounts of LP. The exploit was fixed after the players raked in somewhere around 5 trillion ISK

FCing/LCing
Do you want to take your PVP experience one step further? Become an FC and lead your fleet to victory. It won't make you much money (in the end it will probably cost you more than you make), but you're gonna have a ton of fun, if you're good, you're also gonna get a lot of respect, you might even get noticed and offered a high position (if you're in an alliance for example). 
It's a very challenging, very high skillcap activity. You need patience, leadership capabilities and some very good game knowledge - enemies formed a 30 man Caracal/Osprey fleet, what do you take to counter them?, will you take the fight with your chosen teamcomp, even if you only managed to gather 25 people?, can you kite them and warp away if things go bad? It all requires some really good understanding of EVE's mechanics. The more experience you have, the better. The key is to learn from your mistakes, from all the lost fights you've ever had.


If you think becoming an FC is somewhat out of your reach, you can try to become a Logi Commander. LC is the guy who makes sure to save as many people from dying as possible. You need top-notch micromanagement and multitasking skills. Basically, you'll be the guy who closely monitors broadcast history and tells all other logi pilots how many reps to put and on whom, spreading healing evenly, bait tanking, making sure the rest of your team makes it out alive. Many fleets don't plan on having a Logi Commander, but you can always ask your FC, if you can become one. If you're good, you'll certainly do him a favor.


Alternatively you can become a Logi Anchor (LA). You're only responsible for the positioning of your logis. Every big fleet has one. Essentially, it's LC junior.






*Note: LC is often called LA, even though the meaning is the same.

Defense standing fleet
Casually roam around the territory of your corporation/alliance, in a fleet of friends or even total strangers, eliminating any hostiles that you find and saving your corpmates. In the meantime you can chat and have discussions on all sorts of topics. Usually you get a lot of exciting content, spend your time in a fun way and possibly get some loot too. Often, you'll be the first response to any major fight that breaks out too, even before the FCs ping.

Small gang pvp
Roam around in a group of 2-12 players, looking for PVP fights. Sometimes divided into microgangs (2-5 pilots) and small gangs (6-12 pilots). Usually done for fun, whether you'll make or lose money depends on the skill level of you and your FC.

Baiting
Bait gankers and get money from kill rights and/or loot. There are 2 ways to do this: undock an innocent looking, heavily tanked industrial filled with expensive loot, or become a suspect and make other players attack you, unsuspecting that you are armed much better. In the first case scenario you pray on gankers, especially those relying on high alpha strike (Tornado etc.) to kill you, without scanning your ship first. Therefore, they won't know, that you have multiple times more EHP, that they can deal with a single blast. You'll easily survive their strike, getting a kill right and watching their ship turn into a smoking wreck. You can then make the kill right available to everyone, for a price of course, and if you make it reasonable, the gankers will have to buy it out with an alt.
The second method is a lot more complicated but leaves you with more options. You need to turn suspect (for example stealing from a wreck or attacking mission runner's MTU), this way people will be free to attack you without getting Concorded. Now you just need to beat them in the PVP fight, which should be easy, if you fitted your ship correctly. Make sure your ship doesn't look to strong or people will ignore you, knowing they'll lose the clash.

Solo PVP
Look for 1v1 fights, mainly for fun rather than profit. Often done in inexpensive, disposable ships. Very hard to master. If you're more about making profit, you should try roaming (check out Roaming chapter for more info).

Combat probe ganking
Scan down your unsuspecting victim with combat probes, warp to them and kill them. You get their loot, a nice killmail and good content. Your go-to ships are T3 destroyers and cruisers, since they both have huge (95/99%) scan probe CPU requirements reductions. T3 destroyers are used more often that T3 cruisers because they are much cheaper and you don't lose skillpoints on death (unlike a T3C). For T3Ds, every ship is OK except Confessor. 


The hardest thing about this activity is how hard it is to scan somebody. Your prey can see your combat probes on DScan, as long as they have it configured correctly. On top of that, if they take a warp, you lose your scanning progress. The big ships are pretty easy to scan because of their signature size, but as a T3D, who has 300-400 DPS with max. skills in sharpshooter mode, you might not be able to get them. The ISK you make mainly depends on your luck, but if you're careful and don't die you can make a tidy profit.




To do this efficiently you want to max. out your scanning skills and even use implants.

Roaming
Roam K-space in a PVP fitted ship, looking for people to kill. If you do it for cash you're gonna want to hunt ratters and explorers. If you do it for content, anything that is similiar size to your ship. Also, nullsec is often a better choice than lowsec, because there aren't many crabs here. If you want to do it in lowsec, do so in Faction Warfare area. 
Since it's a PVP activity, it's not really about making money, and even if you want to estimate it, it's very hard because the number of people you encounter, whether they have blingy modules or even if they do, will they drop, depends on your luck. And you can always lose your shiny ship as well. Roaming is mostly about content and having fun, but if you know what you're doing it can make you some money on the side. You can do it solo but it's even better with friends.

Pirating
Destroy ships purely for profit. Money you make mainly depends on your ability to find targets. Can be done in fleet. It's not really an activity but a way of describing other activities. For example solo/fleet PVP is usually done for content, gate/station camping is done for ISK.

Ransoming
Not really a thing anymore, but it used to be really prevailing back in the old days. Now if you make an offer, to spare someone's life for a fee, people will most likely think you're a scammer. I've put it here mostly for reference, because it's definitely not valid as a career path anymore. Maybe you'll get paid once in a blue moon. But will you resist the urge to kill the poor person anyway, grabbing the ransom, loot AND the killmail?

High value target hunting
Locate very expensive targets. trap and kill them. Doing this requires immense effort, dedication and coordination. You're gonna need a team of scouts, people to light cynos, skilled tacklers, logis, caps, EWAR and so on. Sometimes actions like those happen spontaneously and sometimes they are well planned with the help of spies and insiders. A good example of this can be the recent (early December 2019) surprise attack on Goons' Rorqual locust fleet, resulting in a 600b ISK in losses (420b of those being from the trapped Rorquals).


Unfortunately, even when attacks like that are planned, information about them is usually only limited to the trusted leadership, to prevent spying. So, as an average Joe, you can only hope to be in the right place at the right time and not be afraid to join the fleet, especially if there are capital ships involved.

Hotdrop baiting
First of all, to all of new players reading this - now, after cyno changes (August/September 2019), this is much worse than it used to be. The way this activity works is, you bait players into attacking you and BAM you light a cyno, and suddenly capital ships/Black Ops jump on them. You used to be able to fit a Cynosural Field Generator on any ship with a high slot, now it's as follows:


There are 3 types of cynos: normal (for caps), covert (for Black Ops) and industrial (for Jump Freighters but also Black Ops). Here are ships that can light a cyno:


1. Normal Cyno:
   1. Black Ops
   2. Force Recon


2. Covert Cyno:
   1. T3C
   2. Stealth Bomber
   3. Force Recon
   4. Prospect
   5. Covert Ops
   6. Blockade Runner
   7. Black Ops


3. Industrial Cyno:
   1. Venture
   2. T1 industrial
   3. DST
   4. Blockade Runner




As you can see, now you're pretty limited with the ship choice, especially if you're planning to bait (which is what this chapter is about). In the current state of the game, there is no way somebody is gonna fall for a Black Ops/Force Recon bait, so there goes cap dropping. Your best bet is to try and bait with an industrial, a Prospect or a Cov Ops.
If you actually manage to bait someone, light a cyno, and tell your fleet (or alts) to jump to you, kill the attacker and grab the loot.

Gate/station camping
Sit on a crowded gate/station, with a bunch of ships with fast lock times and blow up the ships of anyone who appears. It's not gonna make you rich and it's sometimes boring, but it brings content and you usually earn more than you lose. Also, the more people you have in fleet, the less time you have to spend actively looking. Can be done solo too, but it's more dangerous and you have to watch the grid all the time.

Eviction
Take part in a coordinated effort to kick a corporation out of a certain space (usually a wormhole). It requires a lot of planning and a great variety of tools to to achieve it. Scouts, wormhole rollers, ECM, capacitor warriors are very often in demand. 
You can fly virtually anything but you won't always be allowed to participate because a WH can only allow X amount of mass before it collapses. Usually, you want to bring something small, cruiser and below. You make money from the loot of ships and citadels.
It's worth noting that it can be hard to find a corporation that specializes in eviction, and they may not br particularly exciting. But if you want to try, your best bet would be to ask around in Jita local or on forums.

Wardec spamming
Join a group of players which declares war on an enormous amount, of all sorts of corporations and then camps the trade hubs with instalock high alpha strike ships and T2 logistics cruisers. PIRAT is especially infamous for this. If you're into this type of content, you should probably message them and ask how to join. It's a pretty safe, good profit activity, but it's looked down upon by most of Eve's community, similarly to highsec miner ganking. Also kinda high SP requirements.

Solo WH hunting
Leave a nomadic life, travelling through wormholes, looking for potential prey. Almost always done in cloaky, PVP focused ships (Stratios, stealth bombers, combat recons, black opses). A really fun activity when you find ships, if not, then it's pretty boring. However it can lead to some nice killmails/loot. It's unique because wormholes have delayed Local and if you have cloak (or DScan immunity) there is no way for anyone to know you're lurking to kill them. Generally, if you stay in the busy wormholes, you can get a good amount of content. If you want to see how it looks like, check WINGSPAN TT's videos, links below

Station trading
Probably the most renowned form of trading. You buy with buy orders and resell using sell orders. Done in empire/alliance trade hubs. Margin minus taxes/fees is your raw profit. It's easy, new player friendly, not risky but usually requires a lot of time and somewhat of a big starting capital. 
Depending on the size of the market hub and type of the item you may or may not be forced to check and update your orders frequently. For example, if it's a high volume item in Jita, you'd be lucky to have your order on top for 3 minutes, while another order, for a less popular item in Hek could be left unattended for hours. 
Profit is very hard to estimate accurately, it heavily depends on the max. number of orders, capital and time commitment. However, generally, you can make pretty sweet profits. 


Before you begin trading, make sure you know what to expect. For example a relatively cheap T1 module won't really sell to buy orders because the sell cost is just above the build cost. Another example: T1 rigs, they usually sell in low volumes and cannot be looted from a wreck so you're practically not gonna get any buy order sales. 
Best items are usually those which cannot be produced (meta/deadspace etc.). T2/T3 items are decent as well, because their production chain is much more complicated. Evaluating the market like that is called arbitrage. A very good video on that below.


There are many good tools for finding deals for station trading, like Evernus or Adam4Eve, however Evernus is currently unavailable and Adam4EVE only becomes really good when you take time to scan individual market groups.


Important: with the March 2020 release you can only change the first 4 significant figures on an order (no more 0,01 ISKing) and significantly increasing/decreasing the price now costs a lot of money (% of the price). Keep that in mind when trading high margin items. Your break-even margin is 15%, and that is without the additional update fees. Basically, be prepared to take larger losses.


* Est. ISK/h: Depends, if you sit there regularly updating ~50 expensive orders, you can probably make a couple hundred million an hour. Basically, it depends on your capital/number of orders. It can be a really good but tedious way to make money.
* Training time: 1-60 days to get a satisfying amount of market orders, + you can spend a week or two lowering your taxes + you can also take a day to train Marketing and Daytrading to level 2 and manage orders from Perimeter citadel (Omega recommended)
* Difficulty: 4/10
* Can be done as Alpha: yes

*Current tax values are 5% broker, 5% sale tax. On top of that there is a new relist fee (March 2020), which makes the fees/taxes in those videos outdated. Still, they’re pretty good to watch because the principal remains the same.


Interhub trading
Make money exploiting price difference between trade hubs. It's simple and it can be very profitable. Basically, you only need 3 things:


* 2-5 characters, the more the better, they are placed in Jita and other trade hubs and operate the orders


* Decent starting capital


* A large number of market orders on all of your character (the more orders you have, the more time you have to spend adjusting prices, but you bring lot more income).


I prefer to buy with sell orders and sell with sell orders, but you can also buy-buy or buy-sell. But definitely don't buy with sell orders and sell to buy orders.




You can choose to haul stuff on your own or using public courier contracts.


The hardest part is finding the price differences. You can either use Evernus, evetrade.space or your own spreadsheets. I've always used Evernus, but it's currently unavailable to download. However, there is apparently its remaster coming soon: 


https://forums.eveonline.com/t/revernus-release-null-evernus-re-written/168652
https://evetrade.space/  -  when using this, make sure to double check every single item, (especially for volume), ignore skins/cosmetics and trades that look too good to be true


*Quick disclaimer: to trade this effectively you need to be there to update your orders almost all the time, in all of your trade hubs. If you can't handle that, don't try this or you'll lose money, since price differences even out after some time.




* Est. ISK/month: billions or even tens of billions if you have 5 characters with lots of orders, however remember - you need money to make money
* Training time: you can start from day 1 as long as you have the money, then it will take you a couple of weeks to train more market orders,   for transport use DST/Blockade Runner - both take ~2 months training (Omega)
* Difficulty: 6/10
* Can be done as Alpha: yes




Remote hub trading
Make money by creating your own market, in a system far away from a trade hub, with high traffic, stocking it with popular modules and selling at a much higher margin. You need a hauler, a lot of market orders and decent starting cash (~2b is OK). First, you need to find a system with high traffic. There are many different choices:


1. Level 4 mission systems


2. Incursion systems


3. Busy lowsec system, bonus points if near FW area


4. Highsec/lowsec border, bonus points if LS has inhabitants


5. Lowsec/nullsec border, bonus points if NS has inhabitants


6. Corporations home regions, unless they have their own market (do some research first)


7. War staging systems, (do research first)


8. War zones


9. Capital jump points.




To find your desired system, use Eve's map and Dotlan, with filters such as: "Jumps (24h)", "Pilots currently docked", "Pilots currently active", "Ships destroyed in last 24h", "NPC ships destroyed in last 24h", "Cynosural Fields".


Once you find your new spot, check to find what ships fly by, and bring stuff that is likely to be featured in these fits (check zKillboard). You can also bring ammo/fuel. You can even contact the locals or the corporations waging war and ask what they would like to be brought. Often they will be happy to respond, especially if it means they won't have to fly all the way to home/Jita to buy another fit. 
Once you put up your shopping list. Buy the items in one of the major trade hubs, bring them in and put a significant mark up on the price. Restock once the items start running low. Recommended to have at least a 100 market orders. Generally you won't have any competition so you can leave them and update once a few days or once a week. The further you are from a trade hub, the more you can push up the prices.








* Est. ISK/month: 2-6b with ~100 orders, good spot and keeping your stock updated
* Training time: 1-2 months (Omega training) + additional 2 months for a Blockade Runner/DST  or  4-6 months for a Jump Freighter
* Difficulty: 7/10
* Can be done as Alpha: yes but very unefficiently

Buyer side trading
A trading strategy that allows you to make money from the laziness of others. Basically, you set up lowball, 90 day, regional buy orders, on many different items, in many different regions. Those items can be everything except materials, salvage, minerals, gas, all the high volume stuff used only in industry. How much you lowball, depends solely on you. When I do it, my price is ~35-45% Jita buy price. 
You set up as many buy orders as possible, preferably hundreds, for a diverse selection of items. There are people, who don't want to fly 20 jumps to Jita and would rather quickly cash out their loot and get back to whatever they were doing. When people begin selling to you, you have 2 options:




a) You can get in an industrial, usually a Blockade Runner, haul all that stuff from the entire region to the nearest trade hub and sell it, which is very boring (usually 60-80 jumps total), but you don't have to wait to get all your profit




b) You can relist the items at a much higher price (much even higher than Jita too), and wait for them to sell, which is very slow and takes up your market orders, but you avoid hauling




Both methods are very good income. Personally, I like the first method more, but it's a matter of preference. If you're dedicated, both can bring billions of ISK every month.


Before you start, you must know there are high skill requirements and and it requires a lot of starting capital. You're gonna need:


1. ~5b starting capital
2. As many market order slots as humanly possible
3. Daytrading V
4. Visibility V
5. Procurement V
6. Blockade Runner skills (if you choose option a)
7. Marketing V (if you choose option b)




* Est. ISK/month: billions
* Training time: a) ~6,5 months    b) ~5 months
* Difficulty: 2/10
* Can be done as Alpha: no




Market speculation
Buy items, which you think are going to become more expensive. It's an extremely hard, inconsistent way of making money, but if you catch some good trades, you can make tens of billions. 
Requires a lot of patience, a lot of capital and being on top of all the game related news, so you can buy items before others catch up. There are many people who have made fortunes with patch speculation, but it's like real life trading: 50% hard work 50% luck. If a change you had anticipated would happen, was suddenly reverted or had an opposite effect on the economy and prices, your potential losses could be as big as your potential gains.










* ISK/month: impossible to estimate, depends on the frequency of big patches and their effects on economy (which are very hard to predict)
* Training time: none
* Difficulty: 10/10
* Can be done as Alpha: yes

Market manipulation
A very risky, very tricky, method of making money from the market. Essentially, you want to do anything to buy cheap, move the price higher, and sell. You shouldn't do it with items that can be easily supplied, like T1 modules. 
Best items to manipulate are those which have a limited supply like named and deadspace. Faction items are OK too. When you raise the price, you usually don't want to put it in the market all at once, because people will immediately see the price got manipulated and will heavily undercut you, forcing you to buy them and spend more money. 
Whenever I tried it, in the end, I always lost more than I earned, so I don't really have any good advice. But before you try getting into this too seriously, just dedicate some ISK (max. 200m) into it first, treat it like lost, make as many trades and manipulation attempts as possible and just learn from your mistakes. The best market manipulators are incredibly rich - it's a very lucrative but at the same time a very hard to learn/master profession.




* Est. ISK/month: potentially tens of billions in profits/losses
* Training time: 2-3 weeks for a good amount of market orders + optional tax reducing skills, but to be honest, you can do just fine with only the 13/17 starting orders
* Difficulty: 10/10
* Can be done as Alpha: yes

Extreme highballing
Probably the weirdest, most random trading method that actually works. Basically, there are certain regions, far away from trade hubs, that have almost 0 trade activity going on. There are also certain lazy, very rich people who would rather buy an extremely overpriced module, than travel 25 jumps to Jita. 
So, for example, you put 17 Damage Control II modules in 17 systems of a region, (especially the ones which have the most jumps/24h) for 85m each, 90 day order and wait. I tried it once and sold 2 within the first month. Now keep in mind: it only works on a couple of most popular modules (DCII, Adaptive Invuln II, Hobgoblins II, 5MN Y-T8 etc.), best done in null/lowsec and also, you can't just slam a 500m ISK price tag if you want it to sell.


There is also another similar method, but this time it's a scam. You put a module on sale, made to look cheaper than normal and cheaper than anything in vicinity (usually Perimeter-Jita) hoping that the buyer will not count the zeros. For example a 1,3m item for 1,1b. Always done in a low tax citadel so that the broker fee doesn't eat up all your ISK. It's not very reliable though, as it can be undercut to oblivion.

Scalping
Quick trading strategy which revolves around sell order price differences. You can also call it a very soft market manipulation. Basically, let's say there is an item which has volume of ~100/day. There are buy orders at 10m and sell orders at 22.5m. Suddenly, there comes a lazy guy, who doesn't have patience to babysit a sell order and wants to get more money than from a buy order. So he puts his 8 items at 17m price, knowing that either no one will undercut him or someone will buy it and relist (scalp). 
Now we need to take taxes/fees into account (which are 10% of the sell order). So if we multiply 22.5m by 0,9 we'll get 20.25m. (20.25m-17m) * 8 items = 26m profit after we sell it all. However deals like that are fairly uncommon, so you either scan a lot if items at once or just use it as a secondary part of your trading income.




Important: with the March 2020 release you can only change the first 4 significant figures on an order (no more 0,01 ISKing) and significantly increasing/decreasing the price now costs a lot of money (% of the price). Keep that in mind when trading high margin items. Your break-even margin is 15%, and that is without the additional update fees. Basically, be prepared to take larger losses.

Doctrine seeding
Almost every big corporation/alliance has something called a doctrine, which are standarized fittings/fleet concepts, that every member of that group should train into and use. Because of that, things that make those doctrine ships are in constant, high demand. 
Which is why there are opportunistic traders who will straight up buy as many as many of those fits as they can fit in their Jump Freighter (or even DST if you're low on SP or cash), and put them all on contracts at their home station, with a decent markup (35-45%). 
People will buy this, because it's the quickest and the most optimal way to get back to doing the fun stuff. So, if you want to do this: train into a good industrial ship, preferably a Jump Freighter (safest, a lot of cargo space), find out what ships sell the most (check past Discord pings, losses on zKillboard etc.), buy in Jita, haul, put on contracts, rinse and repeat. You can also use a hauling service but finding one that is cheap enough is pretty hard.




* Est. ISK/month: 300m-4b from sales minus transport costs (income depends on the number of contracts, your budget and market size/demand)
* Training time: ~2 months for a Blockade Runner/DST, 4-6 months for a Jump Freighter (depends if you train crucial skills to level IV or V)
* Difficulty: 5/10
* Can be done as Alpha: yes but you have to find a cheap hauling service

Null hub import/export
Another good way to profit in Eve is to play the nullsec market. Generally, in null, materials and minerals are cheap while modules and equipment are expensive. This happens because mining/exploring/doing PI in your alliance's space is safe, while the finished products have to be manufactured or imported. Usually, this is how it plays out:


1. The very popular modules: Stasis Webifiers, Scrams, Interdiction Sphere Launchers etc. have zero or even negative margins compared to Jita, they are produced on the spot and sell in large volumes
2. The common modules: aren't as popular and are usually imported, since they don't sell in very large volumes - e.x. ECM, Gas Cloud Harvesters, Warp Disruption Field Generators, you can often find items with very nice margins (30%+)
3. The dead modules: specific, very rarely bought, prone to manipulations, very high margin items;


Important: With the ongoing mineral redistribution process which started in February/March 2020, ores in null have become much more scarce (70-90% nerf to null ore anomalies), so keep in mind, that currently, nullsec minerals won’t be as cheap as they used to be. Still, this is subject to change (as of late March 2020).


It's also worth noting that some modules can be exported from null for profit, for example some deadspace modules. People who rat might not have time to haul their loot out and will just lowball it, waiting for somebody else to buy it and haul it.


Now, if you're an opportunistic trader, you'll immediately notice the potential profits. Get in your Jump Freighter, load it with cheap modules and minerals, fly to Jita (or any large tradehub), set up sell orders with an alt, load your ship with less popular modules, fly back to null and set your orders there as well. 
It all comes down to price, volume and margin. If you can sell stuff for much more than you have bought it for, you'll make some nice cash. It doesn't even have to be a Jump Freighter, Blockade Runners and DSTs have plenty of space and are a safe option as well. If you're just starting out as Alpha, you can even do it in a T1 exploration frigate. You can also use shipping services.


You can also combine this with doctrine seeding (see doctrine seeding chapter)


*Remember to take taxes into account when calculating potential profits.


* Est. ISK/month: depends on how much capital you invest, but usually you can make very decent money
* Training time: a couple of weeks for more market orders,  2 months for DST/Blockade Runner  or  4-6 months for a Jump Freighter
* Difficulty: 5/10

Item reprocessing
A very niche and not really a profitable market activity, but sometimes you might find a good opportunity. Basically, you scan the market for named modules (upgraded/compact/enduring/ample/scoped/restrained), check the reprocessed materials from that item, evepraisal it, multiply by 0.6 (with Scrapmetal Reprocessing V) and subtract from the item buy cost. 
If it comes up positive, that means you can profit from this, buying as much as you can from buy orders, reprocessing, and selling the minerals. Keep in mind some modules have a minimum portion size of a 100, so something, that looks like a great profit may turn out to be a moderate loss. Usually the only items that have a minimum portion size are ammo and asteroids. But if you want to be safe, you can always buy 1 piece from sell orders and see, if you can reprocess.


This doesn't work on T1 and T2 modules/ships because they are player made, nor does it on deadspace/faction because they are always have a higher price than their reprocessing values


Personally, I don't recommend this method. Sometimes you can get a nice little profit, even without having hundreds of orders, but if you want to make any real money, you need to invest a really good amount of time, and at this point, you're better off doing PI on multiple characters, with much better ISK/month.




*Reminder: Scrapmetal Reprocessing V only works on modules and ships, so if you try to reprocess ore/ice/moon rocks/asteroids you'll get the regular 50% yield.




* Est. ISK/month: with hundreds of buy orders, at best, you can expect a couple hundred million
* Training time: 1 month for Scrapmetal Reprocessing V + 2,5 month for market orders + optional tax reducing skills
* Difficulty: 2/10
* Can be done as Alpha: not really




















Contract/firesale buyer
Make profit from people, who don't want to haul their stuff. Those people put it on as a firesale on public contracts, allowing anyone to accept it, get a stash of loot for much more cheaper, haul it to a trade hub and sell for good ISK. 
Usually the most profitable contracts take you to null, so Jump Freighter is a must. If you prefer to stay in highsec, you'll only need a T1 Freighter, but beware, the potential money is much, much lower. In order to find the best contracts I recommend using *Adam4EVE's contract tool. It assesses the price and volume, filters them and shows you the most profitable ones.




*Always double check everything with https://evepraisal.com/


If you join a big nullsec group, you'll be able to find many more opportunities, hidden behind the access list.




Before you accept a contract, here are the things to watch out for:
1. Capital ships, they can't enter highsec (except freighters, jump freighters and Orcas)
2. Rigged ships, rigs cannot be detached from the ship, so you need to deduct the value of rigs from the value of contract
3. Crystals (ammo/mining), they are sometimes put up on contracts after already being severely damaged, so you won't be able to sell them on the market
4. Fees and taxes, 5% if you sell to buy, 10% if you sell with sell orders, on top of that the new potential % relist fees; take that into account when considering profit (though you can always train tax reduction skills)




* Est. ISK/month: a couple of billions
* Training time: 1,5 months for a Freighter, 4-6 months for a Jump Freighter
* Difficulty: 6/10
* Can be done as Alpha: no

Buybacks
Somewhat related to null hub import/export. Requires you to be a part of a large group, preferably an alliance. As you may already know, materials can be really cheap in null, because getting them there is easy, safe and profitable. However not a lot of people who mine ore/ice, do PI, make fuel blocks, or explore/salvage use it to power their industrial empires. Many of them just want to make some money on the side, and to liquidate their supply, there needs to be demand. And here come the buybacks, people who offer to buy any amount of the specific stuff, they're interested in, for a reduced but still decent price. Their prices aren't fixed though, almost always it's a % of the current Jita price.


There are 3 types of buybacks:


1. Industrial - these guys buy materials in bulk and use them to manufacture their stuff; if they make caps, they'd want a lot of ore, if they make T2 items they'd want moon goo and PI, if they make rigs they'd want salvage etc.


2. Exporter - they buy in bulk, load their Jump Freighters with the stuff, export it and sell in a tradehub; usually they offer a lot less ISK than industry guys but accept a wide selection of items


3. Reprocessors - those guys take a lot of time training their reprocessing skills to be very high (or max. which, fun fact is 89% yield with perfect skills, implants and rigged POS); they buy raw ore in bulk, reprocess it extremely efficiently and then sell somewhere; or be a professional reprocessing service, where people contract them their ore to reprocess it for them for a fee (% of the value usually).


Important: With the ongoing mineral redistribution process which started in February/March 2020, ores in null have become much more scarce (70-90% nerf to null ore anomalies), so keep in mind, that currently, nullsec minerals won’t be as cheap as they used to be. Still, this is subject to change (as of late March 2020).


You can create your own buyback too, but you need to scout the competition and advertise your service (or usually PM a forum moderator to add you to a megathread) first.




* Est. ISK/month: very hard to estimate, depends on the competition, number of players in your group, supply, and type of industry activity, but you can expect to make decent cash
* Training time: 4-6 months for a Jump Freighter,  ~1 year for reprocessing,  industry - depends on the activity  
* Difficulty: 3/10

T1 manufacture
The simplest form of manufacturing. Generally, it's not very profitable, because the market is often flooded with carebear, highsec, mining/industry corps with the "I mined it so it was free" mentality that sell at an insanely small margin, sometimes even a negative one. Often the only T1 things that can make you ISK are rigs. And obviously capitals but that takes a lot of SP, budget, planning (more on that in capital production chapter). Often it's the best to buy a highly researched BPO from contracts and start from there or just go straight to T2 production.




* Est. ISK/month: maybe 20-50m/BP/, if you manage to find any good items
* Training time: in ~3 days you'll have 4 manufacturing slots; if you're Omega you can go even further, reducing manufacturing time and increasing the number of slots
* Difficulty: 3/10
* Can be done as Alpha: yes


















































Research blueprints
The most passive ISK making activity you could imagine. You buy BPOs, research them to be 10/20 and put them up on contracts for a multiple times higher price. You can make a lot of money this way with an amazing rate of income (money spent to money earned) and amazing time spent-money earned ratio. If you want to get into this first you need to get the right skills, which are:


* Science
* Metallurgy
* Research 
* Laboratory Operation
* Advanced Laboratory Operation
* Advanced Industry (requires Industry III)
* Contracting


* Scientific Networking (optional)
* Cybernetics (optional, for implants)


Don't do this on your main though, since the training time is pretty long.


You can research whatever you want if there is demand for it - the bigger the thing, the more you'll spend time researching it, so not like you can't research small items/ships, but it will be more clicking and more contracts needed.


If you want to research blueprints for yourself, staying at 7/14 is usually the most efficient thing to do:        https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/File:Research_time.png

Copy blueprints
Make money copying highly researched T1 BPOs. Unfortunately it's not really a profitable activity: usually there only is demand for ships, and even then the market is dominated by fully trained industry characters in rigged structures. If you want to try it out you're free to do so, but remember you need a lot of SP and ISK to start and even then you might not turn profit because of no demand or fierce competition.






































































Mining
Mine stuff, reprocess it, and sell on the market. You can mine ore, ice and moon rocks. Moon rocks are pretty much the only thing worth mining, unless you have a Rorqual. Mining ore and ice, at the very best you'll make 60m/h, but usually somewhere around 20-40m/h. Venture however only makes 5m/h. 
The only time you can actually get some good money is Rorqual multiboxing. A single Rorqual makes ~90m/h. The cost of buying Omega with ISK is 55-65m/day, depending on current prices. So if you have 3 Rorqual accounts, you need to PLEX all of them each month, but on average you'll make 30m/Rorqual, in only the first hour of mining. Every single hour past the first is pure profit.
*With the recent nerf to ore numbers Rorquals less effective and harder to manage
You mine ice with the same ships as with ore mining, + Endurance, excluding Venture


Right now, as I’m writing this, with 50% reprocessing yield:


Mining ore will make you 57-166 ISK/m3, (excl. Mercoxit)
Mining ice will make you 123-386 ISK/m3 (calculator's value is in chunks, each chunk is 1000m3)
Mining moon rocks will make you 47-1032 ISK/m3, (R4 moons the lowest, R64 the highest)


You'll always find the best stuff in null.
Often it's better to sell the raw stuff on the market or to a guy with maxed out reprocessing skills, you'll get more money than reprocessing them yourself.


If you're in a major alliance, you should have an easy access to moons, even the high value ones, with an updated moon chunk schedule. This way even a newbro can make some money on the side. And it's pretty much the only way. Generally highsec/lowsec mining is a terrible idea, they are dangerous and give depressing ISK/h, especially if you choose to PLEX with in-game money.


* Est. ISK/h: 20-60m, 100m with Rorqual, 5m with a Venture (ISK/h for standard ore only, you'll make more with good ice and moon rocks; you can calculate ISK/h yourself with the calculator below)
* Training time: <3 days (Venture) / 0,5m (T1 Barge) / >1m (T2 Barge) / >2m (Endurance) / >2m (T1 Exhumer) / <3m (T2 Exhumer) / <5m (Orca) / within a year, since there are many different fits (Rorqual)
* Difficulty: 1/10, watch out for gankers though
* Can be done as Alpha: Venture only

Reactions
Make money purely through reactions. There are 4 types of reactions, but I'll cover only cover 3, since the booster ones are already covered in the booster production chapter. Those reactions are:


* Polymer reactions - you mix 2 types of fullerenes (W-space gas), fuel blocks and some minerals to get polymers, which are used solely for the purpose of T3 production, but are still traded in high volumes on the market


* 1st stage of moon reactions - you mix 2 types of raw moon materials (reprocessed moon rocks), 100 of each and add 5 fuel blocks; and get 200 units of intermediate materials


* 2nd stage of moon reactions - you mix 2-4 types of intermediate materials, 100 of each and add 5 fuel blocks; and get varying amounts of advanced moon materials (composite materials)




Reactions can only be done in refineries (Athanor/Tatara) in lowsec and below. You have to equip them with reactor module(s) first though. You'll only be able to do reactions of the type of reactor you've installed. For example if you only install Standup Hybrid Reactor, you'll only be able to react polymers.


*Note: there are 3 types of reactors: Biochemical, Hybrid and Composite (2 stages of moon reactions can be done using Composite reactor)


Reactions use Reaction Formulas instead of blueprints, which are pretty cheap but cannot be researched. However, you can get material/time efficiency bonus through structure rigs (which only work for 1 reactor type!, if you want to have bonuses to all reactors, you have to equip your refinery with 3 sets of rigs!)


Skills to train:
* Reactions V
* Mass Reactions V
* Advanced Mass Reactions IV (V if you have nothing better to train)
* tax reducing skills (optional but recommended)
* Remote Reactions (optional)


Unless you want to bother and do the shipping yourself, you won't need to train anything other than that.


It's usually the best to do reactions in null, in the well-rigged structures of your alliance. You'll have to deal with a high system cost index and taxes, but you won't need to bother with putting up your own refinery, fueling it regularly, defending it etc.


Also it's worth noting, even though reactions can be very profitable, they can also screw you over. Reaction materials tend to have very unstable prices, often swinging more than 20% within a week. This happens mostly on moon related products, because of alliance moon schedules and exports. Hybrid polymers' also sometimes swing, big reason for that are wormhole residents, who often react gas that they find next door, and export it - rarely, but all in one go.


If you are planning to do moon reactions, it's usually best to do full chain of reactions. And if you're just starting off, buy 2x materials to cover you for your first chain.


Keep in mind it takes a lot of time to keep up with your reactions. Keeping your buy and sell orders on top, importing and exporting will require a lot of effort.

Full T3 chain
T3 production is probably the most complex industry-related activity you can find in New Eden. It's a 4 stage process, with the final results being advanced T3 destroyers and cruisers, used in great numbers all around New Eden. First, this is how the production chain looks like:




1. You invent T3 BPCs (aka reverse engineering), it requires:
   1. Ancient Relics which are found in wormhole sleeper sites (mostly relic - Forgotten) or Silent Battleground sites
   2. Standard and T3 datacores (Core/Defensive/Offensive/Propulsion Subsystem Engineering) the latter being found in wormhole sleeper data sites (Unsecured)
   3. Optional decryptors


Each Ancient Relic is a combination of 2 - quality and type:


Quality:
Intact - highest chance of BPC invention (26% base chance of success, 20-run BPC)
Malfunctioning - medium chance of BPC invention (21% base, 10-run BPC)
Wrecked - lowest chance of BPC invention (14% base, 3-run BPC)


Type:
Small Hull Section - used to invent a T3 destroyer BPC
Hull Section - used to invent a T3 cruiser hull BPC
Armor Nanobot - used to invent a Defensive Subsystem BPC
Power Cores - used to invent a Core Subsystem BPC
Thruster Sections - used to invent a Propulsion Subsystem BPC
Weapon Subroutines - used to invent an Offensive Subsystem BPC
(from UniWiki)


2.  You react fullerenes (W-space gas) with fuel blocks and minerals - you get polymers (reaction process)
3.  You manufacture subsystem components from polymers and sleeper (WH) salvage
4.  You make ships and subsystems using subsystem components.

1) Copying T1 BPO-->T1 BPC - material/time efficiency doesn't matter
2) Inventing T1 BPC-->T2 BPC - requires two different sets of 1-64 datacores, you can also use an optional decryptor which boosts the efficiency, success chance or number of runs; the number of required datacores depends on the size of the object,
3) Manufacturing T2 BPC - requires (often not all of) the following: T1 item, PI, Morphite, Advanced Components, R.A.M




Base T2 BPC has 1 run if it's a ship or a rig and 10 runs if it's anything else. They also have base 2% ME and 4% TE. Those stats then can be modified by a decryptor.
If the invention attempt is unsuccessful you lose 1 run on the T1 BPC, if there was only 1 run left, it disappears.
Invention success chance depends on your level of: Science, Rocket Science and racial encryption method (depends on the race of the object) skill.
Modules rigs and ammo have a base success chance of 34%, frigates have a bit less and the bigger the ship gets, the lower success chance becomes.
The more of the ingredients, that are required to make a T2 item, you make yourself, (instead of buying on the market) the more profit you make in the end.


You can find decryptor stats on UniWiki (link below)

Capital ship production
Capital ship production is one of the higher end industry activities, giving great potential profits but with even greater early investments. Capital ships are produced with capital ship components (excl. Jump Freighters). Those components are produced from standard minerals (like Tritanium or Isogen). Capital ships can be split into 2 sections:


* Those able to fly into highsec - Orcas, Freighters, which are built from 4-7 different capital component types and Jump Freighters which are produced through invention (more on that later)
* Those not able to fly into highsec  - Rorquals, Force Auxillaries, Dreadnoughts and Carriers (and of course supercapitals, more on that in supercapital production chapter) - are built from usually ~12 different capital component types


The number of different capital components gives you a rough idea on starting budget: each BPO costs ~1,5b and needs to be further researched to be (more) profitable.
As a beginner, it's best to start with Orcas and Freighters, they don't require such a high early investment and can be sold in highsec. 
Before you begin, you want to find a well rigged, low tax citadel, join a corp which can offer you one, or just put one up yourself.
Then comes the research part. That can take a long time - ~3-4 months for each component and potentially over a year for the ships. You want to have as many research job slots to do it efficiently. If you don't want to do that, you can buy already researched blueprints off of contracts. They are much more expensive but they can save you time spent training and researching. Also, even though BPOs are expensive you do not want to use BPCs, they will eat into your profits quickly.


If you choose to research, you have to do this in a rigged POS, otherwise it's not worth it at all.


After you're done with the research you can start manufacturing. First you need to find materials. If you're building highsec ships you can buy the minerals with little to no effort, but if you choose to produce ships that cannot fly into highsec, you have to get your minerals from somewhere. There are 3 ways to do this:


1. Mine them yourself (Rorqual + a rigged refinery is recommended)
2. Import them with a Jump Freighter, alternatively a hauling service (compress them first though)
3. Mineral buyback (if you're in a corporation/alliance)




After you have the materials you can finally move on to manufacturing. A single capital component takes very short to produce - only a couple of hours, while the ships take 14-20 days, when well researched. After starting the production of the first ship, you can keep the chain going with the rest of your production slots.




If your end goal are more advanced ships, that can only be produced outside of highsec, it's a good choice to join a group. It will be much safer, provides you with great structures/buyback opportunities and possibly demand for your ships.






The final step you can take as a capital (but not supercapital) ship producer, are Jump Freighters. Those incredibly expensive (~10b) ships take a ton of effort to produce. First, because it's a T2 ship you need to copy and invent the T1 BPO. After you're done with that you produce the T1 version of the ship. Then you usually buy smaller stuff like Morphite or Construction Blocks (~70m total). Then the final, most expensive thing to get are components: a small amount of Capital Jump Drives (the ones that you produce any capital ship with) and the big boys - advanced capital components, which are made from advanced moon materials. You need a couple of different types of those, each requiring hundreds of advanced components. 
All this together makes up for one of the most expensive ship types in the game. Production chain of those is a combination of invention, standard capital production, high-end components production and possibly reactions as well. Huge investment cost, a ton of time spent on careful planning and gathering materials for a big, ultimate profit. They are often produced in highsec.




Things that are very useful to have:
* Money (initial: 20b - highsec ships, 40b - non-highsec ships)
* Multiple accounts
* Scout alt (if producing outside of highsec)
* Interdictor insta-align hauler (to transport BPOs)
* Reprocessing implants and skills (if mining your own stuff or buying just rocks)
* Jump clones




* Est. ISK/month: highsec ships - maybe ~2-3b at best;   non-highsec ships -billions, even tens of billions with multiple accounts
* Training time: 4-18 months - heavily depends on the stuff you are planning to produce, whether you research or not, if you haul or mine, if you train individual reprocessing skills etc.
* Difficulty: 4/10 in highsec,  8/10 not in highsec
* Can be done as Alpha: no

Supercapital production
Similar to capital production but on a MUCH larger scale. Supers can only be built in your sovereign nullsec system, which has Supercapital Construction Facilities infrastructure upgrade, and only in a Sotiyo Engineering Complex with a Standup Supercapital Shipyard I module; you cannot redock in a Sotiyo once you launch them, they can only be docked in a Keepstar citadel. They take months to manufacture, require a LOT of components, and their BPOs are incredibly expensive (similar to the ship costs). There are 2 types of supercapitals:


1. Supercarriers, require Capital Production IV (compared to III for carriers) and ~15x more components than a carrier; they cost 10-15b


2. Titans, the biggest ships in the game, require Capital Production V, cost ~65-75b a piece, are traded only through private contracts (broker fees), and usually also ordered privately






This activity is very much inaccessible for many players. You have to be a part of a well established alliance, have hundreds of billions in budget, multiple accounts, each with over a year of skill training (or more money spent on injectors) and it will take a long while for your investment to pay off, also you might encounter at least some competition in your alliance (because those are pretty much the only people you can sell to), on top of that you have to advertise yourself and make people order from you.






* Est. ISK/month: tens of billions
* Training time: a year or more for each account
* Difficulty: 8/10
* Can be done as Alpha: no




























Booster production
Make money reacting and producing boosters. There are 2 parts that go into the production process: the reactions part, which is the more complex one, and manufacturing part which is easy, but you have to get blueprints first. First let's talk about reactions. 
There are 4 types of reactions, but in this chapter I'll only cover the booster ones. You can find the rest in their respective chapter. Generally, reactions can only take place in refineries, in lowsec and below, which have certain reaction rigs (there are 3 types: for moons, for boosters and for polymers for T3 stuff). For the booster reactions you need 3 things: certain K-space gas, fuel blocks and some bonus item (trade goods or low stage PI). 
You should buy gas with buy orders and the rest is fine to buy from sell orders. Then you wanna transport those materials to your refinery. If your POS is in lowsec, you should use a Blockade Runner. If you live in nullsec, your best bet is to use a hauling service.


You can also harvest gas yourself, especially if you live in null.


There are 4 kinds of boosters:


1a) Synth - those guys are produced from Mykoserocin, in a single reaction process and are much worse than all other boosters, but give no potential harmful side effects. You can expect to make an average of 0,3-1m profit with each sold booster.
1b) Standard - they are produced from Cytoserocin and have much stronger bonuses but can have equally strong side effects. They are produced in a single reaction process. You can expect to make an average of ~1m with each sold booster.
2) Improved - they are produced from 2 Pure Standard booster materials, produced in 3 reactions. You can expect to make an average of 5m with each sold booster.
3) Strong - they are produced from 1 Pure Standard and 1 Pure Improved materials, in a total of 5 reactions. You can expect to make an average of  10-20m with each sold booster.


Now, here comes the tricky part, getting blueprints. Normally they aren't available on the market. You have to either buy them off contracts, (which isn't really a good idea) or get them yourself. They appear in Chemical Labs sites, which are signatures that only appear in lowsec/nullsec, show up as gas sites, but have NPCs in them and require data analyzers to access the drug BPCs and reaction formulas. You can find some details on UniWiki's but they aren't very well documented.


You can also get Synth drugs BPCs in pirate faction LP stores:


* Angels: Sooth Sayer and X-instinct
* Blood Raiders: Mindflood
* Guristas: Blue Pill and Crash
* Sansha’s: Frentix
* Serpentis: Exile and Drop


BPCs have 50 runs by default.




The skills you need are:
* Drug Manufacturing
* Reactions, Mass Reactions, Advanced Mass Reactions
* Mass Production
* Skills for a good PVE ship
* Anchoring+Corporation Management (if you're putting up your own POS)
* Supply Chain Management (optional)




The entire production chain of each booster pill past the first, on average, takes 2,75-3,5h.
Remember to take volume into the account and don't go full throttle on one drug, crashing the market prices.






Note: Some boosters take a little more pure booster material to produce than you get from reactions. You can just ignore it, it won't make much of a difference in the long run. And I'll still count them as a single reaction.

Structure production
Very similar to capital production. Just like when producing caps you'll need a lot of money to start off, a lot of time spent researching components and a lot of time producing a single structure. Blueprints can be very expensive and often take a long time to pay off. Structures however can be produced in highsec and require less SP. And obviously they are produced from structure, not capital components.






Pro tip: Train tax reduction skills if you are planning to produce anything expensive.






* Est. ISK/month: highly depends on the size of the structure, you can make as little as 200m and as much as 5b
* Training time: 2-4 months
* Difficulty: 4/10

PI
A brilliant, semi-passive ISK making activity. You set up planetary production, leave it for a couple of days, get all your stuff and reset it. Raw resources are called P0. Then you mix them to create P1, you mix P1 to create P2 and so on up to P4. The higher the level the more they cost, require more resources from multiple planets to make and more time spent. The are many possible, profitable setups. 
Some people do P0-P2 and then sell, some import P2 then sell as P4, while others do P0-P3 or even the entire chain on multiple characters. Full chain can't be done on a single character because there are 8 planets, you can have command centres set up on the maximum of 6 at once. 
Your ship of choice should be Epithal, T1 industrial with 45k base planetary commodity cargo hold (it increases with each Gallente Industrial level). It's cheap and has short training time. Important thing to know is that you can only process P0 into P1 with a basic factory. To go any higher than that you need advanced factories. 
The most optimal way to do this is to create a planet only for advanced factories (factory planet), where you import all your stuff and go as far down the chain as you want to.




There are amazing websites on the internet which show you PI chains, required planets, profitability etc. Some of the better ones:

* https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b4l49s/tier_234_pi_with_medium_effort_ccu_4_check_every/




There are many great setups you can find posted publicly online or as a guide in your alliance resource page. You can do it in anywhere, even in wormholes. Just a couple of notes:
* Highsec is only useful for factory planets with imported materials, because the production is very low
* Lowsec is not recommended, null is safer and has better yield
* Nullsec is the best when considering both profit, comfort and safety - you join an alliance, find a system with good planets and sell it to buybacks or export it to Jita
* Wormholes bring the best profit but they are more dangerous and you have to scan/wait for a good exit and then export in bulk


To get the best income you should train all the characters on your account to do PI, this way you'll usually at least be able to PLEX your account every month.

Scamming
Use your charisma (or spamming skills), and convince people to accept your falsely advertised contracts or just give you their stuff. You can make decent money by spamming Jita local, but keep in mind you're competing with other scammers for that 1 or 2 people unexperienced enough to fall for it. 
You can definitely get rich but you need to be creative and think outside of the box. For example, individually talk to people. Surprisingly enough, after all this years there are still many people getting scammed everyday, even though that is what EVE is famous for.

Spying
Put an alternate character in a hostile alliance/corporation. Gather info for your allies or just for yourself. You can do that by sitting on your target's Mumble comms, Discord, gently asking around, pretend you're an FC and directly message a scanner who apparently found a good WH connection etc. 
If you're really dedicated, patient, and know your way around you could even eventually get a high enough role, to be able to provide some high quality OpSec information. If you're in a WH corp you can scan the connections from the inside, send bookmarks to your corpmates, and invade/evict them together. If you're in an industrial highsec corp, you can get to know freighter schedules (if they have any), and possibly items they are carrying, so you can gank them. It all depends on your creativity and ability to spot opportunities.

Theft
Perhaps the most evil way of making money in EVE Online. Work for months to get trust of your corpmates/alliance members. When you are deemed trustful and granted a high position, it's your time to shine. 
Steal anything of value that belongs to the corporation, and move it as quickly as possible to the nearest NPC station. Before they notice what's going on and remove you from corp, you're already sitting on a stack of expensive loot that you are waiting to be hauled to Jita. There are many ways to pull a big heist off. If you're really trusted you can do anything.
 If you want this method to work, you need to be very patient, creative, social, approachable, charismatic. Beware, it might not work out.

Loans
Lend your money to other players, on a previously agreed interest rate. Requires a lot of capital. Check the forums for potential clients. I wouldn't really recommend it because there are good chances you'll get scammed and there aren't that many people looking for loans anymore. But if you're friends with someone, who you know you can trust, you can still give him an unofficial loan and make some cash on the side. But really, there are better and safer ways to make money.

Escalation trading
After the changes to the bookmark system (end of November 2019) trading bookmarks became pretty hard. For any new players - you have a ~5% chance to get escalations from combat anomalies and unrated cosmic signatures, the escalation you get can be either a DED rated complex or an expedition.


You used to be able to just drag the bookmark to your inventory, put it on contract and charge 30-120m for it, depending on the level of the escalation/expedition. Right now, you have to make a custom access list and manage who can see it.


The money you make from escalation trading usually comes as a nice addition to anomaly ratting where you have a 5% chance to get something you can trade with another player, again, the higher the anomaly level, the more you’ll make from the potential escalation




























































Rentals
Make money by renting structures or space. Structure renting is not that big of a thing and it's not very popular. It's about renting well rigged, industry citadels for a monthly fee, however, you can often find them publically available, while their owners make money from taxes. But, if you ever want to rent somebody a structure, and actually find a good opportunity, you should ask for a bit less than the structure fuel cost.


Space renting, on the other hand, generally only happens when an alliance rents individual systems/constellations where only those who rent it can interfere. It happens for many reasons, like access to good moons/planets, putting up your private industry POSes with low system cost indexes or unfortunately botting. If other alliance members constantly invade your privacy they can get kicked out. The procedures and terms are usually pretty complicated and depend on the alliance too.






























































Colonising a wormhole
Join a group, find a wormhole and settle down there. It requires a ton of effort to constantly refuel the POS, scan, roll potentially dangerous entrances and defend your new home from any evictors (which is why it's almost never done solo), but it can be a lot of fun. 
It's pretty amazing mainly because there are so many wormhole systems and you can choose one depending on what you want to do. Do you like ganking? Do so in any WH with a highsec static. Do you want to roam together? Wormhole with a null or lowsec static should be your choice. Wanna huff gas? Settle down in a WH with a C5/C6 static. What's more, wormhole planets have the best material yields in the game, highest payout rats, good exploration potential and sleeper salvage/gas needed for T3 industry.

Leadership
Be a CEO of a big corporation or an alliance and make money from taxes. Very hard thing to achieve and it's even harder to be a good leader. You'll have to sacrifice some of your real life to make sure everything is running smoothly in EVE. It's not an activity to make money though, it's about the social aspect and watching your creation grow.

Diplomat
Diplomats handle all social aspects of a corporation/alliance. They are the people who are directly involved in politics, solve issues between parties, send war declaration messages, invite other corporations to become their allies or take care of the recruitment process. 
Because how important their role is, they need to be very trusted and respected in the galaxy and always remain in contact with the CEO of their corporations. 
If you want to become one, just try to live your life in New Eden to the fullest. Join a corporation, start going on ops, speak on forums, don't be afraid to talk to others. It takes a long time for people to deem you trustful enough to give you such a high position though, so don't focus on anything in particular, keep acquiring game knowledge, make others recognize you and see where that will lead you. 
However keep in mind, you might not get paid for this, it all depends on the CEO. Overall, you need good social skills, ability to solve problems and a good game/game politics knowledge.

SIGs
Be a part of a group of players who love and want to do as much of a certain type of gameplay (WH roaming, recon, capitals, mercenaries, industry etc.). If you wanna do it and you're in a big corporation or alliance, you can join a Special Interest Group where your corpmates love it as much as you do and will aim to have fun doing it together.
If you want to join a SIG, or just see what kind of SIGs there are, usually there should be certain megathreads or bulletins in your corporation, with all the information. If not, then just ask around. If you want to be a leader you need an initiative and a lot of game knowledge.

Hauling/courier
Be the delivery guy of New Eden, making money either hauling other people's stuff, or buying things for bargain prices all over the galaxy, hauling them to another station and selling for profit (aka speculative hauling). 
Hauling between hubs won't be covered here, for that check interhub trading chapter. If you want to haul and trade your own stuff you need a big enough cargo and a big enough budget. It's not very profitable, but you can sometimes get some good deals. If you want to try, check "evetrade" link below. When doing this, make sure to double check every order, both price history and volume. And do not take an order if the ROI is <10%. In the end you'll lose money from taxes.


The other career path you can take as a hauler is doing courier contracts. They are pretty popular and there are even corporations that take them to a next level (Red/Black Frog Logistics). Usually, when it comes to public contracts, you won't make too much ISK, and the good deals get picked up quickly, however it can be a good secondary income, for example when you're passing by and see a small courier contract or cheap items on sale.


If you really like hauling, you can join professional hauling corps. This way, you'll make a bit more money and have plenty of contracts to choose from.




When hauling you need to watch out for 2 things: scam contracts and ganks. When it comes to the latter, don't haul expensive stuff in a T1 industrial, and be extra careful in and around Uedama and Niarja. Those are 0.5 pipe systems which you have to go through (otherwise you have to make ~30 additional jumps) when hauling stuff between north and south, or east and west of New Eden. A lot of people get ganked in those systems.
For the scam contracts: people who make those are planning to kill you and get the collateral + a part of their cargo (which is usually very cheap). These contracts usually: last 24h, must be completed within 24h, have small number of jumps, high collateral and low rewards. If you really wanna take the contract that looks like a trap, the best thing you can do is to pick it up with an alt and courier contract it to your hauling account. This way gankers will not know you're about to sneak past them under another name.




If you are planning to haul stuff through really dangerous space, do it right after downtime.




For hauling ship types and what to haul certain stuff, through certain space with, check UniWiki hauling introduction (the top one).
Technically, there are also distribution missions, but I won't cover those. In order to make any profit from them, you need to grind your standings toward L4 missions, and then they make like 15m/h. However if you want to read up on those, link below.




THIS DOESN'T COVER JUMP FREIGHTERS. For that check jump freighting chapter.






Pro tip: when you need to haul small volume, very valuable stuff through nullsec, get in a interdiction nullified T3 cruiser with warp core stabilizers and modules/rigs that decrease align time. It will be next to impossible to stop you.

Jump Freighting
Make money hauling the stuff you have bought, produced or got from a courier contract. Requires you to have a Jump Freighter (~10b), and at least 1 cyno alt, so you have to have at least 2 Omega accounts. You can do it solo or join a low/nullsec hauling corporation, like Black Frog Logistics. To get more info, check those guides:


https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_h3kvuFx2f7HoFlVfjA-be4a7tN_txpoWPstFQJt5ik/edit  -  great JF guide (If you are interested in seeding your own market, check remote hub trading chapter.)
http://archive.evenews24.com/2011/07/31/space-truckin-how-to-make-money-with-jump-freighters/  -  another JF guide


A few disclaimers, because some things have changed (generally, for good):


* Bumping can only be done for 3 minutes, then you enter warp automatically
* Citadel freeport scams are no longer a thing anymore, you can deliver stuff even if you don't have access
* For market tools, use Adam4Eve, Evernus (which you currently can't download, but there its 'remaster' that might become publicly available soon:  https://forums.eveonline.com/t/revernus-release-null-evernus-re-written/168652)
* Cyno changes:


There are 3 types of cynos: normal (for caps), covert (for Black Ops) and most importantly industrial (for Jump Freighters but also Black Ops). Here is what ships can light a cyno:


1. Industrial Cyno:
   1. Venture (which is perfect for JF usage)
   2. T1 industrial
   3. DST
   4. Blockade Runner


2. Normal Cyno:
   1. Black Ops
   2. Force Recon


3. Covert Cyno:
   1. T3C
   2. Stealth Bomber
   3. Force Recon
   4. Prospect
   5. Covert Ops
   6. Blockade Runner
   7. Black Ops


You can also join an alliance and haul stuff at a fixed rate (usually 500-800 ISK/m3). It's a very steady stream of income but you have to find clients first. Good idea is to join an already established JF logistics group (if you find one that is recruiting). But don't fly with empty cargo space, fuel costs! Remember you can always fill your JF with cheap materials and sell it for higher.
If you are planning to haul stuff through really dangerous space, do it right after downtime.

Project Discovery
Project Discovery is an activity in which you analyze planets and stars, and your results are used by real world scientists. You can make a decent amount of money doing this, you don't need to undock from station, don't need any skill requirements and it can be done as an Alpha clone. 
On top of that you get item rewards each level, with milestones being expensive Concord ship BPCs. Can be done when mining or gas harvesting for a decent chunk of additional income. When you reach 500th level, you get a Marshal BPC which you can manufacture and sell for 3.5b profit. But it takes a LONG time to get there. ;)

Excavator hunting
If you consider yourself a madman, enjoy a 'fair' bit of challenge, and are looking for a "never gets boring" activity, excavator hunting is for you. Excavators are the most expensive drones in New Eden, which can only be used by Rorquals, currently 380m per drone. Because of how expensive they are, people had come up with a way to steal them.
Essentially, you have a Cov Ops frigate, that combat scans the rorqual(s) and the drones. It warps itself to them, while staying cloaked. A group of 6 booshers (T2 command destroyers) and a Blockade Runner all warp to the Cov Ops frigate. All booshers use their Micro Jump Field Generators, warping the entire fleet and all the excavators 600km forward. This way they are out of Rorquals control range. They then proceed to ECM jam them, allowing the Blockade Runner to scoop them and the entire fleet warps off. 
Unfortunately, this activity isn't so popular anymore because the excavators' prices dropped drastically after 2 consecutive nerfs (they used to cost over 1b). Before that, there was even a guy who did all that, solo, on 8 different accounts and stole over 1k excavators from Goons (link below). However, if you want to try, it's still possible, you're just gonna make much less money.

Citadel fees
Make money from taxing people who use your citadel. There are 2 ways to do this: market and industry. 


For market - you can make money this way, but it's almost inaccessible to the average Joe and it has to be huge for you to earn any real money. For comparison, the biggest player owned hub in the game: "Perimeter - Tranquility Trading Tower" where most of Eve's real world money transactions happen and where many people make their Jita buy orders to avoid high broker fees, only makes ~18b a month from broker fees.


The other one is when you put up a well rigged, industrial citadel and allow everyone to publically use it but in exchange they pay pretty high taxes (7-10%). As an owner you won't make a lot of money this way but it will help to pay the fuel costs. Either way it's a win-win situation for both sides involved, you getting reduced costs for the fuel of the structure you regularly use and the industry guys get access to a high quality POS for a minor hit to their earnings.




















































Ninja looting/salvaging
Every day, hundreds of billions are destroyed across the universe. A good part of that is destroyed, but the rest drops as cargo, waiting for the winner to take it all for himself. But here come the thieves of New Eden, ninja looters/salvagers - some hate them, but I have some weird sort of respect, when they come out of nowhere, just in time to take all your expensive, well-earned loot, and warp out before you manage to lock them. 
Very hard, very exciting, insanely rewarding, when done right. The are multiple different ways to go at it too. You can be a sneaky T3 Cruiser with Cov Ops and Interdiction Nullifier subsystems, manoeuvring between the wrecks of a giant fleet fight, you can also catch combat activity with your DScan, warp in, cloak up and steal all the stuff when you find an occasion. Or perhaps you want to sit cloaked 150km off the Tama, or any other PVP/gatecamp heavy system, and grab all the stuff after something juicy dies. You can also try your luck stealing loot from highsec gankers.


Keep in mind, when good ships get destroyed, good wrecks drop. You can always salvage T2 (Elite) and T3 (Advanced) wrecks for a expensive, blue salvage. You can get up to 20-30m from a single wreck, however more often you'll get up to 10m. Those wrecks are also hard to salvage, so make sure you either have a lot of salvagers or high quality salvage rigs.


You just need to be where the fights are happening. People lose billions in expensive deadspace/faction modules, and it's there for you to take, while they're busy killing themselves. As long as you're neutral to them, and there are still enemies on grid, they'll probably ignore you.


To find the big alliance fights, from which you can profit the most, you must have a spy, an alt that flies with the fleet, or just go with the fleet on your ninja looter account, but that can get awkward and dangerous real quick.




* Est. ISK/h: very big, if you know what you're doing
* Training time: <1 day (Budget Destroyer) / 1,5-2 months (Blockade Runner)  /  ~2 months (Interdictor)  /  ~3 months (T3C)
* Difficulty: 10/10
* Can be done as Alpha: yes, but only when you fly: a cheap ship that looks like tackle, with high enough cargo, salvage fitting and just go with the fleet; although make sure not to do it on your main or you'll get some bad rep; you'll die fairly often too

Skill injector farming
Skill injector farming also known as SP farming and character farming. It used to be very profitable in the past now it hardly is, but can be used to pay for PLEX. Basically if you have at least 5.5m skill points, you can use a Skill Extractor, to extract 500k skill points and get a Large Skill Injector. If you go for the max. attributes, with neural remaps and implants you can get 3.888x Large Skill Injectors/month. Now the way you calculate the profitability is:


(Large Skill Injector price - Skill Extractor price)*3.888  - 500 PLEX price


At the time of writing this, you make -25m if you use a single character, while paying for Omega. You cannot really undock, because that would risk losing implants. If you use Multiple Pilot Training Certificates, which are cheaper (so 2 or more characters), you can make 240m and 405m monthly, for 2 and 3 characters respectively, while keeping your account Omega, at the time of writing this. If you want to calculate this yourself:


character 1 (plexing) + character 2 (MPTC) + character 3 (MPTC)


[(Large Skill Injector price - Skill Extractor price)*3.888  - 500 PLEX price] + [(Large Skill Injector price - Skill Extractor price)*3.888  - MPTC price] + [(Large Skill Injector price - Skill Extractor price)*3.888  - MPTC price]


Additionally, if there are certain special offers you can get a bigger profit. Also, check PLEX price, you would need to pay to buy something from New Eden Store and compare it to the market price. You might save some money.


Character 3 is optional, you can train any number of characters from 1 to 3.




* Est. ISK/month: depends on the prices, you can calculate it yourself using the above formulas
* Training time: you need to get to 5m SP first, which will be ~6 months as Alpha, ~3 months as Omega, can be lowered with skill injectors, cerebral accelerators or implants
* Difficulty: 0/10
* Can be done as Alpha: no, you can only get to 5m SP threshold, which you can do for free but slower, if you don't choose to PLEX

Journalism
Write articles for EVE related websites about: news, opinion on recent changes, experiences, cool stories - basically whatever you want. You can also be an editor, artist or even a streamer. Generally requires some good game knowledge and experience first, though. 
Pay varies, depending on the site and whether they publish the article or not. For example, you can be a casual writer for the INN (Imperium News Network) and get paid 200m per article and 300m if they publish it (max. 1 per month). 
If you choose to be a professional writer you can submit as many as you want, but you have to submit at least 1 per month. Artists/photographers get paid 200m for every original piece of art. Another example is Crossing Zebras: 250m per article. There is also New Eden Report, but they don't provide any additional info. The last news website is EveNews 24 but they don't hire any journalists.

Spreadsheets creator
Create advanced spreadsheets that import data straight from API, calculate taxes, margins, find most profitable: station trades, interhub trades, manufacturing jobs, reactions, market reprocessing etc. 
If they are good, you can sell them for billions, to, potentially, many people. Or if you're an trade/industry kind of guy, you can use them yourself. Overall, a very profitable activity, it only requires some top-notch Excel handling skills. If you want to sell your spreadsheet, your best bet are EVE's official forums, make sure you list its features and show it in action (for example on a Youtube video). Alternatively you can give it a try in Jita local.

IT specialist
One of the more interesting and unique money making methods is being an "IT specialist". Basically, if you're good at programming, know how to design a website etc., you can help your corporation/alliance with all the stuff related to it, creating it, keeping it clean and organised, and get paid for it: in ISK, or even in real world money. 
It's not really a popular money making method, because it's hard to find an organisation that needs your help, it's inconsistent profit, you name it. But well, there are many things you can turn into income in New Eden, even something as unusual as this.

Collecting corpses
No, it's not a prank. You can literally make money stealing corpses. As horrific as it may sound, there are people who will pay big money for bodies of: game developers, GMs, alliance leaders, renowned FCs, people who made the name for themselves etc. 
Even if you decide to stockpile corpses of ordinary people you might still sell them for a couple hundred thousand. For the exceptional ones you can get hundreds of millions, sometimes even billions. 
If you do wanna get into this, join a big corp/alliance and try to take part in as many fights as possible. Then after the dust settles, and other people begin to loot the wrecks, you take care of the bodies. Finding the buyer can be very hard though. You can also save them for yourself, as a symbolic trophy of your victories.






* Est. ISK/h: very hard to estimate, depends on: how many fights you participate in, if you live till the end, if your fleet wins and you can go scavenge, how big the fight was and if you actually find a buyer
* Training time: as long as you want, you can use any ship type
* Difficulty: the only difficult part is the fighting part, check PVP chapter for info regarding specific ships/roles/warfare types
* Can be done as Alpha: yes
