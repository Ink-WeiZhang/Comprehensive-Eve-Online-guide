This project was created by a capsuleer named Vladimir Memento in order to help new players get into Eve Online. 
As I take a longer break from Eve I upload this here so that everyone can come and keep this project updated as Eve continues to evolve.

Below you have a link to the Google Doc where I originally posted the guide. I don't know if it will stay the same, compared to what you'll find here, because it might be kept updated by two different groups of people.
